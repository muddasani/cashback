            <description>Having reunited in 2003 with their original line-up, Duran Duran follow up with a collection of their videos. Masters of the format, the band undoubtably owe a sizeable part of their reputation to lavish productions such as the "Wild Boys," "Girls on Film," and "Rio" videos. This collection gathers together a variety of material, including the full-length original videos, as well as alternate versions, outtakes, interviews, television appearances, and a large amount of DVD-ROM material. Offering a fascinating history of the band, this collection runs through their 80s teen-superstardom, to their more considered, adult-contemporary material from the 90s, and leaves the future wide-open for the reconvened band to once again add a further fascinating chapter to the Duran Duran story.

            <description>This version of Jane Austen's fiercely beloved novel has the daunting task of living up not only to the classic book, but also to the excellent 1995 miniseries of the same name. Yet 2005's PRIDE &amp; PREJUDICE is up to the task, thanks to lively pacing, a witty script, an excellent cast, and clever direction from British newcomer Joe Wright. The surprisingly still-relevant story follows the five Bennet sisters as they deal with suitors and love, as their mother desperately schemes to marry them off advantageously. Sweet-tempered beauty Jane (Rosamund Pike) develops feelings for the equally amiable and extremely wealthy Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods), but forces conspire to keep them apart--while Lizzie (Keira Knightley) finds herself first appalled by, but gradually drawn to, Bingley's aloof, intelligent, and socially awkward friend, Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFayden). The movie, at just over two hours, is forced to cut and condense a number of the book's subplots, and at times it tries to heighten the drama of certain scenes. But, for the most part, it's as faithful to the spirit of the original as time and cinematic convention allow.The tremendous supporting cast includes Brenda Blethyn as Mrs. Bennet and Donald Sutherland as her wry, withdrawn husband; Jena Malone as teenage twit Lydia; Judi Dench, effortlessly haughty and imperious, as Lady Catherine de Bourg; and Tom Hollander, who steals every scene he's in as the ludicrously pompous and awkward Mr. Collins. The movie's script, adapted by Deborah Moggach, manages to be proto-feminist without becoming anachronistic--and, like the novel, it is incisive about the class politics and gender inequalities of the day.

But, for the most part, it's as faithful to the spirit of the original as time and cinematic convention allow.The tremendous supporting cast includes Brenda Blethyn as Mrs. Bennet and Donald Sutherland as her wry, withdrawn husband; Jena Malone as teenage twit Lydia; Judi Dench, effortlessly haughty and imperious, as Lady Catherine de Bourg; and Tom Hollander, who steals every scene he's in as the ludicrously pompous and awkward Mr. Collins. The movie's script, adapted by Deborah Moggach, manages to be proto-feminist without becoming anachronistic--and, like the novel, it is incisive about the class politics and gender inequalities of the day.

            <description>Jim Sonzero's remake of Kiyoshi Kurosawa's Japanese horror hit KAIRO (2001) is a techno-thriller cowritten by Wes Craven (SCREAM, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET). Kristen Bell (VERONICA MARS) stars as Mattie, a student whose ex-boyfriend, Josh (Jonathan Tucker), goes through a strange transformation, then hangs himself. His depression seems to have emanated from a computer program he was working on--which continues running even when it's not plugged in. As they delve deeper into what happened to Josh, Mattie and her best friends, Isabell (Christina Milian), Stone (Rick Gonzalez), and Tim (FREAKS AND GEEKS veteran Samm Levine), start seeing bizarre images that none of them can explain as more and more people around them are dying unexplainable deaths. With the help of Dexter (LOST's Ian Somerhalder), Mattie begins putting the details together, leading to a frightening and surprising conclusion. Sonzero's feature-film directorial debut is a claustrophobic examination of where technology such as computers and cell phones might lead, and loosely falls into the same genre as films like Takashi Miike's ONE MISSED CALL (2003) and Gore Verbinski's THE RING (2002). Elia Cmiral's creepy score adds to the tension. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

            <description>Starring Sir John Mills, the various QUATERMASS movies and television show were a hugely popular end-of-the-world themed staple for science fiction fans of the 1970s. Mills plays Professor Bernard Quatermass, a rocket scientist who decides to renege on his retirement and help save a rapidly decaying world. Surveying the carnage that surrounds him in London, Quatermass observes gang rule on the streets, a threat from a malevolent force from beyond the stars, and a society on the brink of collapse. Drawing on the ruling elite from across the planet to help him, the brilliant scientist attempts to save the world in his own inimitable manner. All four episodes from the television series are included here, as well as the little-seen full length feature film THE QUATERMASS CONCLUSION.  Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.

            <description>Jamie Foxx stars in this biopic of legendary soul and R&amp;B singer Ray Charles. Skillfully edited and with a keen eye for period detail, the narrative weaves in and out of the past in an interlocking tapestry of the man's rise to fame in the 1950s and '60s. Growing up poor, black, and blind in the rural south, Charles learns--under the tutelage of his tough-love mother (Sharon Warren)--to turn these handicaps into assets. With this training, Ray eventually plays his way into a major deal with Paramount records and earns icon status as an American legend. Along the way, the high cost of fame leads him to engage in abusive relationships, manipulative behavior, and struggles with drug and alcohol problems. This is a dynamite film for the music alone (Charles's actual recordings are used in the film), but Foxx's career-benchmark performance transcends RAY's biopic roots, turning this into a piercing, full-on character study: unflinching, sometimes harrowing, and ultimately deeply moving. The sheer joy of Charles's music comes alive in Foxx's movements, and his character matures convincingly and powerfully. A stellar supporting cast is on hand to back him up every step of the way, including Larenz Tate as producer Quincy Jones, and Kerry Washington as Ray's long-suffering wife, Regina.

            <description>Jamie Foxx stars in this biopic of legendary soul and R&amp;B singer Ray Charles. Skillfully edited and with a keen eye for period detail, the narrative weaves in and out of the past in an interlocking tapestry of the man's rise to fame in the 1950s and '60s. Growing up poor, black, and blind in the rural south, Charles learns--under the tutelage of his tough-love mother (Sharon Warren)--to turn these handicaps into assets. With this training, Ray eventually plays his way into a major deal with Paramount records and earns icon status as an American legend. Along the way, the high cost of fame leads him to engage in abusive relationships, manipulative behavior, and struggles with drug and alcohol problems. This is a dynamite film for the music alone (Charles's actual recordings are used in the film), but Foxx's career-benchmark performance transcends RAY's biopic roots, turning this into a piercing, full-on character study: unflinching, sometimes harrowing, and ultimately deeply moving. The sheer joy of Charles's music comes alive in Foxx's movements, and his character matures convincingly and powerfully. A stellar supporting cast is on hand to back him up every step of the way, including Larenz Tate as producer Quincy Jones, and Kerry Washington as Ray's long-suffering wife, Regina.

            <description>In this thriller from director Stephen Hopkins (LOST IN SPACE, UNDER SUSPICION), Oscar winner Hilary Swank is Katherine Winter, a college professor who refutes mysteries and so-called miracles with scientific evidence. When science teacher Doug Blackwell (David Morrisey) invites Katherine and her former teaching assistant/current colleague, Ben (Idris Elba), to his hometown of Haven, Louisiana, to investigate a river whose water has turned blood-red following the mysterious death of a local boy, the cynical professor is forced to find her own faith. The river of blood is just the first in a series of strange occurrences in Haven. It seems that each of the 10 plagues from Exodus is being manifested, in order. The citizens of this Bible Belt town are convinced that 12-year-old Loren McConnell (AnnaSophia Robb) is responsible for her brother's death and for the strange events. Soon, Katherine finds herself questioning everything as memories from her past suddenly infiltrate the present in her search for the truth.The Deep South setting is both beautiful and creepy--particularly Doug's classic antebellum mansion, and the swamps where the McConnell family lives. Swank is reliably solid as Katherine, a woman of faith who lost everything important to her and turned to science for answers. Young AnnaSophia Robb, a young actress to watch, has a captivating screen presence. Brits David Morrissey and Idris Elba (THE WIRE) round out the main characters, with Morrissey a convincing Southern gentleman and Elba a man who overcame his tough life on the streets to become a professor. Stephen Rea also appears as Father Costigan, a link to Katherine's sad past. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

            <description>In this thriller from director Stephen Hopkins (LOST IN SPACE, UNDER SUSPICION), Oscar winner Hilary Swank is Katherine Winter, a college professor who refutes mysteries and so-called miracles with scientific evidence. When science teacher Doug Blackwell (David Morrisey) invites Katherine and her former teaching assistant/current colleague, Ben (Idris Elba), to his hometown of Haven, Louisiana, to investigate a river whose water has turned blood-red following the mysterious death of a local boy, the cynical professor is forced to find her own faith. The river of blood is just the first in a series of strange occurrences in Haven. It seems that each of the 10 plagues from Exodus is being manifested, in order. The citizens of this Bible Belt town are convinced that 12-year-old Loren McConnell (AnnaSophia Robb) is responsible for her brother's death and for the strange events. Soon, Katherine finds herself questioning everything as memories from her past suddenly infiltrate the present in her search for the truth.The Deep South setting is both beautiful and creepy--particularly Doug's classic antebellum mansion, and the swamps where the McConnell family lives. Swank is reliably solid as Katherine, a woman of faith who lost everything important to her and turned to science for answers. Young AnnaSophia Robb, a young actress to watch, has a captivating screen presence. Brits David Morrissey and Idris Elba (THE WIRE) round out the main characters, with Morrissey a convincing Southern gentleman and Elba a man who overcame his tough life on the streets to become a professor. Stephen Rea also appears as Father Costigan, a link to Katherine's sad past. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

            <description>In this powerful film about the fragility of the American dream, Mae and Tom Garvey (Sissy Spacek and Mel Gibson) are farmers at a time (the mid-1980s) when bankers, real-estate agents, and nature itself threaten to destroy their way of life. When the local river floods and nearly destroys the farms around it, hardship hits the area. The Garveys are also at odds with the local power authority and one of its chief officers, Joe Wade (Scott Glenn), who has plans to build a dam and flood the land for a hydroelectric project. Though the family stoically attempts to continue working its farm, massive debts and a poor season finally force Tom Garvey to accept a low-paying factory job as a scab. As they struggle to keep going, Wade hovers vulturelike over the Garvey farm, waiting for its demise. Director Mark Rydell's THE RIVER is a truly beautiful, subtly heartwrenching, and unique film that captures the seldom-seen pleasures of living and growing up in an endangered world--that of the family farm. When the Garveys and their children work the land and tend the animals proudly and happily, their sun-drenched farm seems like paradise. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.

            <description>The Rock (aka Duane Johnson) firmly establishes himself as a major Hollywood force in THE RUNDOWN, an engaging action-comedy directed by Peter Berg. Johnson/Rock plays Beck, a retriever-for-hire, who is sent on one final mission before he can retire and realize his dream of opening up a restaurant. Trading in the cement streets of Los Angeles for the jungles of the Amazon, Beck begins his quest to locate his boss' son, Travis (Seann William Scott). When he walks into the establishment of the beautiful Mariana (Rosario Dawson), he does just that. But before he can drag Travis back to the airstrip and deliver him to his father, the evil Hatcher (Christopher Walken) arrives and reminds Beck that this is his jurisdiction. Apparently, Travis is incredibly close to locating a rare relic, and until that happens, Hatcher isn't letting Travis out of his sight. Of course, Beck uses his talent for kicking butt to escape with Travis, but after their jeep tumbles off a mountain, they find themselves trapped in the jungle with Hatcher hot on their trail. Berg's film breathes with a lighthearted air that is truly refreshing for the action genre, while the relentlessly hilarious interplay between The Rock and Scott is a sight to behold.

            <description>The Rock (aka Duane Johnson) firmly establishes himself as a major Hollywood force in THE RUNDOWN, an engaging action-comedy directed by Peter Berg. Johnson/Rock plays Beck, a retriever-for-hire, who is sent on one final mission before he can retire and realize his dream of opening up a restaurant. Trading in the cement streets of Los Angeles for the jungles of the Amazon, Beck begins his quest to locate his boss' son, Travis (Seann William Scott). When he walks into the establishment of the beautiful Mariana (Rosario Dawson), he does just that. But before he can drag Travis back to the airstrip and deliver him to his father, the evil Hatcher (Christopher Walken) arrives and reminds Beck that this is his jurisdiction. Apparently, Travis is incredibly close to locating a rare relic, and until that happens, Hatcher isn't letting Travis out of his sight. Of course, Beck uses his talent for kicking butt to escape with Travis, but after their jeep tumbles off a mountain, they find themselves trapped in the jungle with Hatcher hot on their trail. Berg's film breathes with a lighthearted air that is truly refreshing for the action genre, while the relentlessly hilarious interplay between The Rock and Scott is a sight to behold.

            <description>Television director/actor Clark Johnson makes an impressive feature-film debut with S.W.A.T. Inspired by the 1970s show of the same name, S.W.A.T. is set in modern day Los Angeles. Recently demoted officer Jim Street (Colin Farrell) gets a chance to redeem himself when aging veteran Hondo (Samuel L. Jackson) is put in control of a new team. Joining Jim are Deke Kay (LL Cool J), Michael Boxer (Brian Van Holt), T.J. McCabe (Josh Charles), and Chris Sanchez (Michelle Rodriguez), all outcasts in their own right. But after an intense training period, the team is ready to hit the streets. Their first big assignment involves one of the world's most dangerous criminals, Alex Montel (Olivier Martinez), who makes an on-camera declaration that he'll give $100 million to whoever breaks him out of jail. Pretty soon, everyone's trying to get a piece of the action, including Jim's former partner, Brian Gamble (Jeremy Renner), who uses his own S.W.A.T. team experience to plot the escape of a lifetime. It's up to Hondo and Jim to outsmart the bad guys and make sure that Alex is safely transported to a federal penitentiary. S.W.A.T. is an entertaining adventure made all the more engaging because of the way Johnson concerns himself equally with the quality of the film's drama and its action.

            <description>Laura Hillenbrand's best-selling nonfiction novel comes to life with this spectacular big-screen adaptation. Set in the 1930s, SEABISCUIT weaves its story around three men who turned a seemingly untamable horse into a bona fide champion. Jeff Bridges is Charles Howard, a thriving entrepreneur who gives horse racing a shot when his wife leaves him after the death of their son. Chris Cooper is Tom Smith, a mumbling, sensitive horse trainer who sees the untapped potential of Seabiscuit hiding under his flawed outer shell. Tobey Maguire is Red Pollard, a stubborn, oversized jockey who is determined to prove to the world that he has what it takes to be a champion. Together, these men use their individual gifts to mold Seabiscuit into a national icon, culminating in a showdown with Triple Crown winner War Admiral. But when Red breaks his leg riding another horse, Howard must call in George Woolf (played by real life jockey Gary Stevens) to keep the dream alive.In adapting Hillenbrand's celebrated novel, writer-director Gary Ross condensed many of the book's characters and events yet his film retains the inspirational spirit of the source material, resulting in a crowd-pleasing, feel-good drama that will have audiences cheering all the while.

            <description>Laura Hillenbrand's best-selling nonfiction novel comes to life with this spectacular big-screen adaptation. Set in the 1930s, SEABISCUIT weaves its story around three men who turned a seemingly untamable horse into a bona fide champion. Jeff Bridges is Charles Howard, a thriving entrepreneur who gives horse racing a shot when his wife leaves him after the death of their son. Chris Cooper is Tom Smith, a mumbling, sensitive horse trainer who sees the untapped potential of Seabiscuit hiding under his flawed outer shell. Tobey Maguire is Red Pollard, a stubborn, oversized jockey who is determined to prove to the world that he has what it takes to be a champion. Together, these men use their individual gifts to mold Seabiscuit into a national icon, culminating in a showdown with Triple Crown winner War Admiral. But when Red breaks his leg riding another horse, Howard must call in George Woolf (played by real life jockey Gary Stevens) to keep the dream alive.In adapting Hillenbrand's celebrated novel, writer-director Gary Ross condensed many of the book's characters and events yet his film retains the inspirational spirit of the source material, resulting in a crowd-pleasing, feel-good drama that will have audiences cheering all the while.

            <description>A classic Western regarded by many as the best of the genre, John Ford's THE SEARCHERS has been acknowledged by several directors who came into their own in the 1970s, including Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Paul Schrader, and George Lucas, as a powerful influence on their work. The film stars John Wayne as Ethan Edwards, a case-hardened Civil War veteran returning to his brother Aaron's (Walter Coy) Texas home in 1868. When Rev. Samuel Johnson Clayton (Ward Bond) arrives to raise a posse to run down the Comanche who have stolen the cattle of neighbor Lars Jorgenson (John Qualen), Ethan is among those who join him. They return to find the Edwards family slaughtered and the two girls, Lucy (Pippa Scott) and Debbie (Natalie Wood), missing. The posse continues to search for the girls but turns back as winter settles in. However, Ethan and his reluctantly accepted companion, Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter), the girls' part-Cherokee stepbrother, press on for another seven years, with the Indian-hating veteran becoming ever more fanatical as the hard seasons pass. In his epic meditation on racism, obsession, paranoia, and the myth of the West, Ford explores the ugly underside of a genre that he had imbued with optimism in his early career. Wayne gives perhaps his most powerful performance as the embittered Edwards, but it's the visual poetry of what are possibly Ford's most carefully framed, lit, and composed images that shape this masterwork from beginning to end. As Wayne walks through the doorway at the film's end, he grabs his elbow in a tribute to his and Ford's close friend Harry Carey Sr., a Western film icon who had passed away a few years before.

The film stars John Wayne as Ethan Edwards, a case-hardened Civil War veteran returning to his brother Aaron's (Walter Coy) Texas home in 1868. When Rev. Samuel Johnson Clayton (Ward Bond) arrives to raise a posse to run down the Comanche who have stolen the cattle of neighbor Lars Jorgenson (John Qualen), Ethan is among those who join him. They return to find the Edwards family slaughtered and the two girls, Lucy (Pippa Scott) and Debbie (Natalie Wood), missing. The posse continues to search for the girls but turns back as winter settles in. However, Ethan and his reluctantly accepted companion, Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter), the girls' part-Cherokee stepbrother, press on for another seven years, with the Indian-hating veteran becoming ever more fanatical as the hard seasons pass. In his epic meditation on racism, obsession, paranoia, and the myth of the West, Ford explores the ugly underside of a genre that he had imbued with optimism in his early career. Wayne gives perhaps his most powerful performance as the embittered Edwards, but it's the visual poetry of what are possibly Ford's most carefully framed, lit, and composed images that shape this masterwork from beginning to end. As Wayne walks through the doorway at the film's end, he grabs his elbow in a tribute to his and Ford's close friend Harry Carey Sr., a Western film icon who had passed away a few years before.

            <description>Beloved television cult director Joss Whedon (BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, ANGEL) makes a spectacular first foray onto the big screen with SERENITY, the cinematic adaptation of his wildly popular but short-lived sci-fi series, FIREFLY. A mix of space western, comedy, and drama, SERENITY follows captain Malcolm "Mal" Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) and his ragtag crew as they trade their way around the edges of civilized society. Of particular interest are two passengers they take on, Simon and River Tam (Sean Maher, Summer Glau), a brother and his telepathic sister on the run from the corrupt governing Alliance. As notorious former members of the anti-Alliance opposition, Mal and his crew make it difficult for Simon and River to stay hidden. Everything goes completely awry when a government assassin is sent to retrieve River. As Mal is forced to choose between his close-knit crew and the brother and sister newcomers, it becomes apparent that River harbors both a dangerous secret and astounding fighting powers, and Mal decides that discovering the truth about what she knows might just be worth his time.Many of the film's action sequences revolve around Summer Glau's martial arts skills in her portrayal of River. Glau prepared for her role with Hong Kong stuntwoman Ming Lu, as well as stunt coordinators Chad Stahelski and Hiro Koda, and as a resulted performed nearly all the stuntwork herself. In addition to the stellar stunts, realistic graphics, and an often haunting score, the film's actors display a rare chemistry that brings viewers both into their lives and into a possible version of humanity's future.

            <description>Beloved television cult director Joss Whedon (BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, ANGEL) makes a spectacular first foray onto the big screen with SERENITY, the cinematic adaptation of his wildly popular but short-lived sci-fi series, FIREFLY. A mix of space western, comedy, and drama, SERENITY follows captain Malcolm "Mal" Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) and his ragtag crew as they trade their way around the edges of civilized society. Of particular interest are two passengers they take on, Simon and River Tam (Sean Maher, Summer Glau), a brother and his telepathic sister on the run from the corrupt governing Alliance. As notorious former members of the anti-Alliance opposition, Mal and his crew make it difficult for Simon and River to stay hidden. Everything goes completely awry when a government assassin is sent to retrieve River. As Mal is forced to choose between his close-knit crew and the brother and sister newcomers, it becomes apparent that River harbors both a dangerous secret and astounding fighting powers, and Mal decides that discovering the truth about what she knows might just be worth his time.Many of the film's action sequences revolve around Summer Glau's martial arts skills in her portrayal of River. Glau prepared for her role with Hong Kong stuntwoman Ming Lu, as well as stunt coordinators Chad Stahelski and Hiro Koda, and as a resulted performed nearly all the stuntwork herself. In addition to the stellar stunts, realistic graphics, and an often haunting score, the film's actors display a rare chemistry that brings viewers both into their lives and into a possible version of humanity's future.

            <description>Gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, wrath, pride, and lust--these are the seven deadly sins that are being punished with unimaginable cruelty and calculation by an enigmatic killer in David Fincher's bleak thriller SEVEN. Set in a perpetually gloomy unnamed city, the film follows Somerset (Morgan Freeman), a retiring police detective, as he experiences his final week on the job, reluctantly working with assertive newcomer Mills (Brad Pitt). When an obese man is found brutally murdered in his home, the seasoned Somerset realizes this is no ordinary killing--someone tortured him because of his appetite. Slayings that reflect the sins of greed and sloth soon follow, leading Somerset and Mills on a desperate search to find the mysterious John Doe, who is responsible for these methodical murders. As the case builds to a startling conclusion, both Somerset and Mills become more involved than they ever could have imagined.After a brief opening scene, SEVEN immediately cuts to a highly stylized title sequence. An intricate collage of books and photos, scissors and razors, and blood and skin eerily captures the dark, graphic tone of Fincher's intriguing mystery. The film cleverly avoids depicting most acts of violence onscreen, focusing instead on the cryptic remains of the crimes, allowing viewers to investigate along with the detectives. An example of nearly flawless filmmaking, the movie features a meticulously crafted screenplay, brilliant photography and design, sure-handed direction, and excellent performances from the entire cast. All of these elements combine to amazing effect in the film's unforgettably stunning finale. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

            <description>Opening with spectacular aerial shots of a beautiful, mountainous landscape, Stanley Kubrick's horror classic THE SHINING sucks the viewer into his frightening tale with quiet, relaxing visuals--but the ominous soundtrack warns that all is not right at the gorgeous Overlook Hotel. Based on Stephen King's best-selling novel, the film stars Jack Nicholson at his eyebrow-raising best in his portrayal of Jack Torrance, a Vermont schoolteacher working at the Overlook as a winter caretaker. The glorious early-20th century resort only operates in warm weather because the snowy roads deny access in the colder months, so Jack brings his wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall), with him, as well as his young son, Danny (Danny Lloyd), who possesses some unique psychic powers. As the Torrances settle in for the long, lonely months ahead, strange, unexplainable things start occurring in the hotel--and in every scene Jack seems to be growing a little more evil and dangerous....Cinematographer John Alcott (who also worked on BARRY LYNDON and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE) allows his Steadicam to float eerily through the deserted halls and corridors of the hotel, creating a creepy air of tension as Jack plummets into madness. Kubrick's obsessive eye for detail is prevalent throughout; the famous scene where Danny rides his toy buggy through the hotel is remarkable for Alcott's gliding camerawork and the desolate sound of the wheels alternately scraping across the hardwood and carpeted floors. Nicholson and Duvall are outstanding throughout, with both actors running the full gamut of human emotions as the film races towards a thrilling conclusion. Supplemented by an oddball cast of dead twin girls, suicidal ax-murdering ghosts, Scatman Crothers as the hotel cook, and many other weird and wonderful figures, Kubrick's film is a pulse-racing treat that is among the best in his inimitable body of work.

            <description>Opening with spectacular aerial shots of a beautiful, mountainous landscape, Stanley Kubrick's horror classic THE SHINING sucks the viewer into his frightening tale with quiet, relaxing visuals--but the ominous soundtrack warns that all is not right at the gorgeous Overlook Hotel. Based on Stephen King's best-selling novel, the film stars Jack Nicholson at his eyebrow-raising best in his portrayal of Jack Torrance, a Vermont schoolteacher working at the Overlook as a winter caretaker. The glorious early-20th century resort only operates in warm weather because the snowy roads deny access in the colder months, so Jack brings his wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall), with him, as well as his young son, Danny (Danny Lloyd), who possesses some unique psychic powers. As the Torrances settle in for the long, lonely months ahead, strange, unexplainable things start occurring in the hotel--and in every scene Jack seems to be growing a little more evil and dangerous....Cinematographer John Alcott (who also worked on BARRY LYNDON and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE) allows his Steadicam to float eerily through the deserted halls and corridors of the hotel, creating a creepy air of tension as Jack plummets into madness. Kubrick's obsessive eye for detail is prevalent throughout; the famous scene where Danny rides his toy buggy through the hotel is remarkable for Alcott's gliding camerawork and the desolate sound of the wheels alternately scraping across the hardwood and carpeted floors. Nicholson and Duvall are outstanding throughout, with both actors running the full gamut of human emotions as the film races towards a thrilling conclusion. Supplemented by an oddball cast of dead twin girls, suicidal ax-murdering ghosts, Scatman Crothers as the hotel cook, and many other weird and wonderful figures, Kubrick's film is a pulse-racing treat that is among the best in his inimitable body of work.

            <description>Steven Soderbergh followed up his critical and commercial smash ERIN BROCKOVICH with this wildly exhilarating exploration of the complex, multilayered international drug problem. The film tells three seemingly disparate stories that loosely intersect and overlap, unfurling at a frantic, relentless pace. In the first, a well-intentioned Mexican police officer, Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro), comes face-to-face with the hypocrisy and hopelessness of his situation after he learns that his superior, General Salazar (Tomas Milian), isn't the law-abiding officer he claims to be. In the second, Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), a conservative Supreme Court judge from Ohio, takes a position as the president's new drug czar. What he doesn't realize is that his teenage daughter, Caroline (Erika Christensen), is falling prey to the dangerous narcotics that he has been hired to eradicate. In the third section, federal agents Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis GuzmÃ¡n) are baby-sitting Eduardo Ruiz (Miguel Ferrer), a drug smuggler who is about to testify against the wealthy Carlos Ayala (Steven Bauer). When Ayala's pregnant wife, Helena (Catherine Zeta-Jones), learns of her husband's illegal activities, she takes her family's future into her own hands. Soderbergh's bold decision to photograph the film using three strikingly different visual schemes adds even greater punch to TRAFFIC, which stands firmly as one of 2000's most stirring motion picture events.

            <description>Antoine Fuqua (THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS, BAIT) turns up the intensity level with TRAINING DAY, a charged drama about police corruption in downtown Los Angeles. Ethan Hawke stars as Jake Hoyt, a well-intentioned young officer who thinks he's found his ticket to becoming a detective in the form of undercover officer Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Harris is a notorious figure in the streets and in the office. He also has the authority to make Jake's professional wishes come true, provided Jake is able to prove his worth on Alonzo's team. At first, Alonzo's blunt, carefree demeanor provides a shock to Jake's optimistic system, but as it becomes clear that Alonzo is dangerously out of control, Jake must decide whether or not to risk his future in the name of the law.Washington's performance as the evil, pragmatic detective is a sight to behold. He delivers his lines with a devilish ferocity that keeps the film bubbling throughout. Hawke slips into the role of the rookie everyman with ease, providing a good contrast to Washington's fiery presence.

            <description>Antoine Fuqua (THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS, BAIT) turns up the intensity level with TRAINING DAY, a charged drama about police corruption in downtown Los Angeles. Ethan Hawke stars as Jake Hoyt, a well-intentioned young officer who thinks he's found his ticket to becoming a detective in the form of undercover officer Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Harris is a notorious figure in the streets and in the office. He also has the authority to make Jake's professional wishes come true, provided Jake is able to prove his worth on Alonzo's team. At first, Alonzo's blunt, carefree demeanor provides a shock to Jake's optimistic system, but as it becomes clear that Alonzo is dangerously out of control, Jake must decide whether or not to risk his future in the name of the law.Washington's performance as the evil, pragmatic detective is a sight to behold. He delivers his lines with a devilish ferocity that keeps the film bubbling throughout. Hawke slips into the role of the rookie everyman with ease, providing a good contrast to Washington's fiery presence.

            <description>In this action-packed disaster film set in America's heartland, an ex-husband-and-wife team of storm chasers rushes to be the first to study the dynamics of tornados with some fascinating new technology. Though Helen Hunt (AS GOOD AS IT GETS) and Bill Paxton (APOLLO 13) star--along with a pre-fame Philip Seymour Hoffman--the uncredited lead roles are the tornados, created with eye-dazzling computer-generated effects. SPEED director Jan de Bont takes the helm for this massive box office hit, while bestselling author Michael Crichton contributed the fast-moving story. TWISTER earned Academy-Award nominations for its achievements in sound and visual effects. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

Though Helen Hunt (AS GOOD AS IT GETS) and Bill Paxton (APOLLO 13) star--along with a pre-fame Philip Seymour Hoffman--the uncredited lead roles are the tornados, created with eye-dazzling computer-generated effects. SPEED director Jan de Bont takes the helm for this massive box office hit, while bestselling author Michael Crichton contributed the fast-moving story.

            <description>Faithful to the conventions of the World War II genre, Mostow's (BREAKDOWN) submarine thriller pays earnest homage to the pluck and determination of ordinary people forced to overcome extraordinary odds. The mostly young and inexperienced crew of the S-33 is deployed on a top secret, high-priority mission to intercept a disabled German u-boat (the titular U-571) and capture the ship's encryption system--the Enigma--in order to crack the Nazi's communication codes and hasten an allied victory in the North Atlantic. Racing against a German rescue effort, the S-33 stages a daring raid on the U-571. But after capturing the U-571, the Americans find themselves its prisoner as they must pilot the leaky, disabled vessel through hostile enemy waters. McConaughey (EDTV, DAZED AND CONFUSED) leads a strong cast (Keitel - HOLY SMOKE, Paxton - A SIMPLE PLAN) in this fast-paced, tense, submarine adventure. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.

            <description>The ORIGINAL TELEVISION CHRISTMAS CLASSICS collection presents a trio of timeless holiday favorites produced by Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin, Jr., for ABC-TV in the 1960s and '70s. RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER (1964) uses innovative puppetry and stop-motion animation to tell the story of an outcast reindeer, an aspiring-dentist elf, and an island of misfit toys who help Santa save Christmas. FROSTY THE SNOWMAN (1969) is a heartwarming cartoon about a snowman who springs to life with the help of a magical hat and the love of a lonely little girl. And SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN (1970) is another stop-motion classic that reveals the origins of Kris Kringle as a young do-gooder who works hard to overcome a toy-hating tyrant and deliver toys to all the children of the world. Beloved by children and adults alike, the threesome are joined by the bonus features FROSTY RETURNS (1993) and THE LITTLE DRUMMER BOY (1968) for nostalgic holiday viewing.

            <description>He made a name for himself in cage fights and the UFC circuit, now Mirco Cro-Cop Filipovic is taking his martial arts skills to the big screen in his debut feature. Filipovic plays a highly trained deadly assassin code-named Sphinx, a man who always hits his target. That is until he unexpectedly fails a secret mission, and in his classified circle of the government a mishap like this usually ends in death. But the Sphinx is too valuable a player, and his superiors have something else in mind. They've decided to send him to an island prison with five other operatives who have been sent there for various reasons. In order to survive this little game, he's going to need every one of his deadly skills, and the same tactics that made him a superstar in the ring translate to this action-packed film where refusing to fight is not an option, it's a death sentence.

            <description>He made a name for himself in cage fights and the UFC circuit, now Mirco Cro-Cop Filipovic is taking his martial arts skills to the big screen in his debut feature. Filipovic plays a highly trained deadly assassin code-named Sphinx, a man who always hits his target. That is until he unexpectedly fails a secret mission, and in his classified circle of the government a mishap like this usually ends in death. But the Sphinx is too valuable a player, and his superiors have something else in mind. They've decided to send him to an island prison with five other operatives who have been sent there for various reasons. In order to survive this little game, he's going to need every one of his deadly skills, and the same tactics that made him a superstar in the ring translate to this action-packed film where refusing to fight is not an option, it's a death sentence.

            <description>Although the artwork in the opening credits would lead you to believe otherwise, writer/director Kurt Wimmer (EQUILIBRIUM) reportedly based ULTRAVIOLET not on a comic book but on John Cassavetes's 1980 film GLORIA, in which a woman must protect a young boy who is carrying some information sought by the Mafia. In ULTRAVIOLET's mid-21st century, a virus has turned part of the earth's population into "hemophages," vampire-like creatures with heightened speed and dexterity, and a fascist government is intent on stamping them out. Enter Violet (Milla Jovovich), a hemophage determined to fight for her people. Her battle takes an unexpected turn, however, when she finds herself protecting Six (Cameron Bright), a mysterious young child who was raised in a lab.Tailor-made for young action fans raised on anime and videogames who want nothing more than to see a beautiful heroine leave a path of destruction behind her, ULTRAVIOLET cross-pollinates plot threads from popular franchises like THE MATRIX and UNDERWORLD. Creating a brightly hued, soft-focus environment constructed entirely with CGI and a green screen, ULTRAVIOLET's look is much like SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW (2004). Cementing the reputation she established with similar athletic, minimally clothed roles in THE FIFTH ELEMENT and the RESIDENT EVIL films, Jovovich will go down in the books as a sci-fi femme fatale for the ages. Her Ultraviolet--who inexplicably changes her hair color and outfits seemingly at will--is a lethal melding of Morticia Adams at a rave and KILL BILL's Bride. Pulling off moves that clearly demonstrate the training she underwent for the role, and usually with a bare midriff, she gives her fans plenty to enjoy. Wimmer wisely leaves the door open for further adventures in the saga. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

Her battle takes an unexpected turn, however, when she finds herself protecting Six (Cameron Bright), a mysterious young child who was raised in a lab.Tailor-made for young action fans raised on anime and videogames who want nothing more than to see a beautiful heroine leave a path of destruction behind her, ULTRAVIOLET cross-pollinates plot threads from popular franchises like THE MATRIX and UNDERWORLD. Creating a brightly hued, soft-focus environment constructed entirely with CGI and a green screen, ULTRAVIOLET's look is much like SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW (2004). Cementing the reputation she established with similar athletic, minimally clothed roles in THE FIFTH ELEMENT and the RESIDENT EVIL films, Jovovich will go down in the books as a sci-fi femme fatale for the ages. Her Ultraviolet--who inexplicably changes her hair color and outfits seemingly at will--is a lethal melding of Morticia Adams at a rave and KILL BILL's Bride. Pulling off moves that clearly demonstrate the training she underwent for the role, and usually with a bare midriff, she gives her fans plenty to enjoy. Wimmer wisely leaves the door open for further adventures in the saga. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

            <description>In Clint Eastwood's acclaimed Western, Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman), a sadistic, dictatorial sheriff, enforces gun control on a tiny frontier town, doling out his own brand of due process as he sees fit. When he denies justice to the prostitutes of the town brothel, one of whom has been slashed by a client, the women hire Bill Munny (Eastwood), a reformed gunslinger, to gain vengeance. However, Munny must contend with his new moral code in the face of revisiting the life he left behind. Eastwood's directorial masterpiece also stars Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris.

            <description>In Clint Eastwood's acclaimed Western, Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman), a sadistic, dictatorial sheriff, enforces gun control on a tiny frontier town, doling out his own brand of due process as he sees fit. When he denies justice to the prostitutes of the town brothel, one of whom has been slashed by a client, the women hire Bill Munny (Eastwood), a reformed gunslinger, to gain vengeance. However, Munny must contend with his new moral code in the face of revisiting the life he left behind. Eastwood's directorial masterpiece also stars Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris.

            <description>Martial arts superstar Jet Li reteams with French writer-director Luc Besson (KISS OF THE DRAGON) in this psychological action film shot in Glasgow, Scotland. Li stars as Danny, a human attack dog for a powerful mobster he calls Uncle Bart (Bob Hoskins, looking resplendent in white suit after white suit). When Bart and his men go out on their collection runs, they bring Danny, who has been trained since he was a child to fight to kill. When Bart takes Danny's collar off and commands, "Get 'im," Danny goes to work, an unstoppable machine, using the only weapon he knows: his body. But when a turf war ends up in bloody carnage, Danny escapes and is taken in by a kind family consisting of blind piano tuner Sam (Morgan Freeman) and his teenage stepdaughter, Victoria (Kerry Condon). They teach Danny how to be a real person, to be able to act civilly in society. They also allow Danny to explore his love of the piano, where a specific tune haunts him, bringing up repressed memories from his long-ago past. Just when Danny thinks he has escaped from his former life, he is pulled back in, but he is no longer the trained dog Bart thinks he is. Written by Besson and directed by Louis Letterier (THE TRANSPORTER), UNLEASHED is a gripping, heart-wrenching film fueled by the music of Massive Attack and a relentless visual style. And having taken acting lessons for the first time in his career, Li more than holds his own in the presence of such masters as Hoskins and Freeman. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.

            <description>Martial arts superstar Jet Li reteams with French writer-director Luc Besson (KISS OF THE DRAGON) in this psychological action film shot in Glasgow, Scotland. Li stars as Danny, a human attack dog for a powerful mobster he calls Uncle Bart (Bob Hoskins, looking resplendent in white suit after white suit). When Bart and his men go out on their collection runs, they bring Danny, who has been trained since he was a child to fight to kill. When Bart takes Danny's collar off and commands, "Get 'im," Danny goes to work, an unstoppable machine, using the only weapon he knows: his body. But when a turf war ends up in bloody carnage, Danny escapes and is taken in by a kind family consisting of blind piano tuner Sam (Morgan Freeman) and his teenage stepdaughter, Victoria (Kerry Condon). They teach Danny how to be a real person, to be able to act civilly in society. They also allow Danny to explore his love of the piano, where a specific tune haunts him, bringing up repressed memories from his long-ago past. Just when Danny thinks he has escaped from his former life, he is pulled back in, but he is no longer the trained dog Bart thinks he is. Written by Besson and directed by Louis Letterier (THE TRANSPORTER), UNLEASHED is a gripping, heart-wrenching film fueled by the music of Massive Attack and a relentless visual style. And having taken acting lessons for the first time in his career, Li more than holds his own in the presence of such masters as Hoskins and Freeman. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.

            <description>All varieties of otherworldly creatures come out to play in Stephen Sommers' gothic carnival. Frankenstein's monster, ferocious werewolves, vampire bat babies, a maniacal scientist named Igor, and a CGI Dr. Jekyll are just a few. When they come together, a thrilling fantasy adventure results, making VAN HELSING a visual feast. Destined to fight the world's evil, Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is a warrior in a cowboy hat and a trench coat, heavily armed with a rapid-fire multi-arrow crossbow, among other gadgetry. A legion of monks in Rome send Van Helsing to Transylvania to hunt the immortal Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh), who terrorizes the local people with the help of his three vampire brides. Especially threatened is the vixen Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), whose family also strives to kill the Count. Van Helsing and Anna Valerious work together, searching for the secret door to Dracula's lair. But it is only after massive battles involving impossible stunts, races on horse-pulled carriages, and the desecration of enchanting medieval castles (all done with dizzying computer graphics) that they succeed. Not only does the eye candy keep on coming, the tongue-in-cheek writing and deep Transylvanian accents perfect the film with a dose of dark humor. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.

            <description>All varieties of otherworldly creatures come out to play in Stephen Sommers' gothic carnival. Frankenstein's monster, ferocious werewolves, vampire bat babies, a maniacal scientist named Igor, and a CGI Dr. Jekyll are just a few. When they come together, a thrilling fantasy adventure results, making VAN HELSING a visual feast. Destined to fight the world's evil, Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is a warrior in a cowboy hat and a trench coat, heavily armed with a rapid-fire multi-arrow crossbow, among other gadgetry. A legion of monks in Rome send Van Helsing to Transylvania to hunt the immortal Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh), who terrorizes the local people with the help of his three vampire brides. Especially threatened is the vixen Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), whose family also strives to kill the Count. Van Helsing and Anna Valerious work together, searching for the secret door to Dracula's lair. But it is only after massive battles involving impossible stunts, races on horse-pulled carriages, and the desecration of enchanting medieval castles (all done with dizzying computer graphics) that they succeed. Not only does the eye candy keep on coming, the tongue-in-cheek writing and deep Transylvanian accents perfect the film with a dose of dark humor. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.

            <description>In the summer of 1970, Stephen (Kevin Costner) returns to his family in Mississippi after a stint in the Vietnam War, his emotional and psychological scars leave him depressed and alienated, while struggling to overcome the nightmare of post traumatic stress disorder. His wife Lois (Mare Winningham) becomes the one forced to struggle to keep food on the table, working grueling double shifts as a waitress and forced to rely on welfare. And his children, Stu (Elijah Wood) and Lidia (Lexi Randall) have it no easier: they're caught in a battle with a group of neighborhood bullies over a tree house that they built out of junk to be a safe haven for their friends, while trying to escape the pressures of school and life in a small Southern town. Ironically, these small-town hostilities are what finally help Stephen come to terms with the larger war he fought in Vietnam. And as he tries to communicate his personal philosophy about violence to his son Stu, the two create a bond stronger than any they have ever had before. By summer's end, both Stu and Lidia gain a new respect for their father's beliefs of peace and understanding as they discover the startling insights into themselves and the world around them.

            <description>A stylish thriller that recalls David Fincher's SEVEN, THE WATCHER is set in the urban landscape of modern Chicago. The story follows Los Angeles transplant Joel Campbell (James Spader), an ex-police detective who has relocated to Chicago in order to escape his past. It appears that a dangerous serial killer, David Allen Griffin (Keanu Reeves), has formed a special emotional attachment to Campbell, luring him to Chicago in order to continue their deadly game of cat-and-mouse. Each game commences when Griffin sends Campbell a picture of a young girl, giving Campbell 24 hours to track her down before she's murdered. After three tragic failures, the stakes are upped when Griffin kidnaps Campbell's beautiful psychiatrist, Polly (Marisa Tomei), mimicking an earlier event that drove Campbell to Chicago in the first place.THE WATCHER is a commentary on modern society's effect on people: making them crudely unable to notice the peripheral people in their daily lives. First-time director Joe Charbanic shoots his film like a music video, using elliptical editing, slow motion, and a postindustrial soundtrack that greatly reflects the Chicago music scene. As the tortured detective, Spader possesses an internal fire that gradually builds in intensity as the film progresses. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.

            <description>Director John Boorman's passionate adaptation of Sir Thomas Malory's LE MORTE D'ARTHUR stars Nigel Terry as the faithful King Arthur. Necromancer Merlin (Nicol Williamson) offers the magic sword Excalibur to the warlike Uther Pendragon (Gabriel Byrne) in exchange for a promise that he'll make peace with his enemy, the duke of Cornwall (Corin Redgrave). He agrees but breaks his word after catching sight of Cornwall's wife, Igraine (Katrine Boorman). With the magician's help he makes love to the woman in the guise of her husband. She bears a child, Arthur, who is taken by Merlin as payment for his assistance and left in the care of Ector (Clive Swift). Years pass, and the boy, now a humble squire, pulls Excalibur from the stone in which Uther had sunk it--a task no other could accomplish. With Merlin's counsel, he marries the stunning Guenevere (Cherie Lunghi), finds a champion in Sir Lancelot (Nicholas Clay), subdues the skirmishing knights, and builds the Round Table to unite them. Yet his half-sister, Morgana (Helen Mirren), lurks in the shadows, preparing to poison her brother's reign. Perhaps the best film made in this genre, EXCALIBUR benefits from an extraordinary cast, including appearances by Byrne, Patrick Stewart, and Liam Neeson early in their celluloid careers. Counterpointing ethereally filtered sex scenes against scenes of graphic blood-and-guts swordplay, Boorman's sumptuous production galvanizes the familiar mythology, as he charts the transition from an age of magic to one of reason.

            <description>Director John Boorman's passionate adaptation of Sir Thomas Malory's LE MORTE D'ARTHUR stars Nigel Terry as the faithful King Arthur. Necromancer Merlin (Nicol Williamson) offers the magic sword Excalibur to the warlike Uther Pendragon (Gabriel Byrne) in exchange for a promise that he'll make peace with his enemy, the duke of Cornwall (Corin Redgrave). He agrees but breaks his word after catching sight of Cornwall's wife, Igraine (Katrine Boorman). With the magician's help he makes love to the woman in the guise of her husband. She bears a child, Arthur, who is taken by Merlin as payment for his assistance and left in the care of Ector (Clive Swift). Years pass, and the boy, now a humble squire, pulls Excalibur from the stone in which Uther had sunk it--a task no other could accomplish. With Merlin's counsel, he marries the stunning Guenevere (Cherie Lunghi), finds a champion in Sir Lancelot (Nicholas Clay), subdues the skirmishing knights, and builds the Round Table to unite them. Yet his half-sister, Morgana (Helen Mirren), lurks in the shadows, preparing to poison her brother's reign. Perhaps the best film made in this genre, EXCALIBUR benefits from an extraordinary cast, including appearances by Byrne, Patrick Stewart, and Liam Neeson early in their celluloid careers. Counterpointing ethereally filtered sex scenes against scenes of graphic blood-and-guts swordplay, Boorman's sumptuous production galvanizes the familiar mythology, as he charts the transition from an age of magic to one of reason.

            <description>Director Ronny Yu (FREDDY VS. JASON) tells the story of Chinese hero Huo Yianjia in JET LI'S FEARLESS. Born in the late 1800s to a martial-arts master in the Tianjin region of China, Huo Yianjia (Jet Li) is not allowed to train at his father's school because he has asthma. Later, as an adult, the self-taught Yianjia becomes a master in his own right with his own school and disciples. His only goal: to become the Champion of Tianjin--and he is willing to fight any and every challenger. Along the way, Yianjia's pride takes over and he becomes obsessed with both praise and revenge, missing the true purpose and message of the martial arts. When his quest for revenge results in tragedy, Yianjia embarks on a new journey, leaving Tianjin.Returning to his home years later, Yianjia is a new man, understanding the connection between body, mind, and soul. Instead of fighting for personal gain, he sees the importance of maintaining the national identity and pride of the Chinese people. Focusing on the importance of good sportsmanship and unity, Yianjia starts the Jingwu Sports Federation, bringing all the schools of martial arts together. Most important, he makes history in Shanghai in 1910 by defending the honor of the Chinese people in a contest against representatives from the four major foreign powers in China. Based on a true story, the film features detailed period settings and costumes, as well as superior stunts. Jet Li evokes a wide range of emotions as Yianjia, instilling the character with life and capturing the essence of this important chapter in Chinese history. Dong Yong stars as Yianjia's loyal friend, Nong Jinsun, and Sun Li plays Moon, a young woman who befriends Yianjia when he leaves Tianjin. This film is in Chinese with English subtitles.

            <description>Jack Stanfield (Harrison Ford) is an average family man in Seattle who heads up the hi-tech security team at his local bank. But following a seemingly trivial case of identity theft, Jack's life is turned upside-down when he discovers that his wife (Virginia Madsen) and two kids have been kidnapped. The ransom? A mere $100 million, which the kidnappers, led by Bill Cox (Paul Bettany), want Jack to obtain for them via his expert computer skills. Initially compliant, Jack is soon irked by Cox and his cronies to the point where he decides to get his family back and bring the bad guys to justice. British Director Richard Loncraine (WIMBLEDON) uses this basic premise to orchestrate a number of frantic set-pieces, while Ford concocts a character similar to his take on Dr. Richard Kimble in THE FUGITIVE. With a mouthful of computer jargon and nimble fingers that tumble frantically over a keyboard whenever he's in front of a computer, Ford's character is an unlikely action hero. Meanwhile, Bettany's bad guy gives subtly sinister instructions in his clipped British accent, Robert Forster (JACKIE BROWN) provides a likeable if underused ally for Ford, and Madsen slots neatly into her wife-in-peril role. As the film builds to an explosive climax Loncraine dumps the gadgets and carves out a delirious romp through action-movie conventions, ultimately infusing an old-fashioned story with a twist of 21st-century techno-fear.

            <description>Jack Stanfield (Harrison Ford) is an average family man in Seattle who heads up the hi-tech security team at his local bank. But following a seemingly trivial case of identity theft, Jack's life is turned upside-down when he discovers that his wife (Virginia Madsen) and two kids have been kidnapped. The ransom? A mere $100 million, which the kidnappers, led by Bill Cox (Paul Bettany), want Jack to obtain for them via his expert computer skills. Initially compliant, Jack is soon irked by Cox and his cronies to the point where he decides to get his family back and bring the bad guys to justice. British Director Richard Loncraine (WIMBLEDON) uses this basic premise to orchestrate a number of frantic set-pieces, while Ford concocts a character similar to his take on Dr. Richard Kimble in THE FUGITIVE. With a mouthful of computer jargon and nimble fingers that tumble frantically over a keyboard whenever he's in front of a computer, Ford's character is an unlikely action hero. Meanwhile, Bettany's bad guy gives subtly sinister instructions in his clipped British accent, Robert Forster (JACKIE BROWN) provides a likeable if underused ally for Ford, and Madsen slots neatly into her wife-in-peril role. As the film builds to an explosive climax Loncraine dumps the gadgets and carves out a delirious romp through action-movie conventions, ultimately infusing an old-fashioned story with a twist of 21st-century techno-fear.

            <description>Loosely based on the book by Gregory McDonald, director Michael Ritchie's FLETCH is a laugh-out-loud comedy that features a classic performance by Chevy Chase, who stars as Irwin "Fletch" Fletcher, a crack investigative journalist who goes undercover for a story about possible connections between the L.A. police department and the local drug trade. He gets derailed when a Santa Monica businessman, Alan Stanwyk (Tim Matheson), mistakes him for a homeless man and offers him $50,000 to commit a murder. The man claims to have terminal bone cancer but can't commit suicide if he wants his family to collect on his insurance policy, so he wants Fletch to do his dirty work. Fletch pretends to accept the offer and finds that it leads him deeper into the heart of his own investigation. Working from a crackling script by Andrew Bergman, Chase relishes every line of dialogue written for his goofy, master-of-disguise character, making FLETCH one of the most influential and oft-quoted comedies of the 1980s.

            <description>It's been a long, strange trip since Darren Aronofsky last invited viewers into his cinematic world--six years in fact--but THE FOUNTAIN is sure to enchant, beguile, and inspire intense debate among his patient fans. During the frustrating gap since 2000's REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, Aronofsky has struggled to bring THE FOUNTAIN to the screen, principally because leading man Brad Pitt dropped out of the project. The complex tale is split into three different time periods, beginning in the 16th century, when a conquistador named Tomas (Hugh Jackman) strives to find the Tree of Life. The second part of the story finds Jackman playing a Buddha-like character who zips through outer space and dreams of a woman named Izzi (Rachel Weisz). And the third part, which consumes most of the film's screen time, is set in the present day and sees Jackman playing a doctor named Tommy, who is married to the terminally-ill Izzi. In this third section Tommy strives to find a cure for Izzi's brain tumor, and makes some progress after experimenting on a monkey with a substance discovered in a tree in South America. Meanwhile, Izzi has been writing a book that she calls THE FOUNTAIN, but has left the final chapter for Tommy to write. As Aronofsky pushes and pulls his sepia-tinted film between the three time periods, he weaves a deeply thoughtful, special effects-laden story that touches on themes of mortality and self, and requires a great deal of work from the director's audience. Movies such as Kubrick's 2001 and Tarkovsky's SOLARIS come to mind as Aronofsky gets deep into philosophical waters, and the various story strands of THE FOUNTAIN are as inconclusive and open to interpretation as the films that have clearly influenced it. The film makes for uneasy and sometimes confusing viewing, but will find its audience among intrepid souls who are fully prepared to let go and immerse themselves in Aronofsky's peculiar, daring, and thoughtful cinematic universe.

            <description>It's been a long, strange trip since Darren Aronofsky last invited viewers into his cinematic world--six years in fact--but THE FOUNTAIN is sure to enchant, beguile, and inspire intense debate among his patient fans. During the frustrating gap since 2000's REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, Aronofsky has struggled to bring THE FOUNTAIN to the screen, principally because leading man Brad Pitt dropped out of the project. The complex tale is split into three different time periods, beginning in the 16th century, when a conquistador named Tomas (Hugh Jackman) strives to find the Tree of Life. The second part of the story finds Jackman playing a Buddha-like character who zips through outer space and dreams of a woman named Izzi (Rachel Weisz). And the third part, which consumes most of the film's screen time, is set in the present day and sees Jackman playing a doctor named Tommy, who is married to the terminally-ill Izzi. In this third section Tommy strives to find a cure for Izzi's brain tumor, and makes some progress after experimenting on a monkey with a substance discovered in a tree in South America. Meanwhile, Izzi has been writing a book that she calls THE FOUNTAIN, but has left the final chapter for Tommy to write. As Aronofsky pushes and pulls his sepia-tinted film between the three time periods, he weaves a deeply thoughtful, special effects-laden story that touches on themes of mortality and self, and requires a great deal of work from the director's audience. Movies such as Kubrick's 2001 and Tarkovsky's SOLARIS come to mind as Aronofsky gets deep into philosophical waters, and the various story strands of THE FOUNTAIN are as inconclusive and open to interpretation as the films that have clearly influenced it. The film makes for uneasy and sometimes confusing viewing, but will find its audience among intrepid souls who are fully prepared to let go and immerse themselves in Aronofsky's peculiar, daring, and thoughtful cinematic universe.

            <description>It's been a long, strange trip since Darren Aronofsky last invited viewers into his cinematic world--six years in fact--but THE FOUNTAIN is sure to enchant, beguile, and inspire intense debate among his patient fans. During the frustrating gap since 2000's REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, Aronofsky has struggled to bring THE FOUNTAIN to the screen, principally because leading man Brad Pitt dropped out of the project. The complex tale is split into three different time periods, beginning in the 16th century, when a conquistador named Tomas (Hugh Jackman) strives to find the Tree of Life. The second part of the story finds Jackman playing a Buddha-like character who zips through outer space and dreams of a woman named Izzi (Rachel Weisz). And the third part, which consumes most of the film's screen time, is set in the present day and sees Jackman playing a doctor named Tommy, who is married to the terminally-ill Izzi. In this third section Tommy strives to find a cure for Izzi's brain tumor, and makes some progress after experimenting on a monkey with a substance discovered in a tree in South America. Meanwhile, Izzi has been writing a book that she calls THE FOUNTAIN, but has left the final chapter for Tommy to write. As Aronofsky pushes and pulls his sepia-tinted film between the three time periods, he weaves a deeply thoughtful, special effects-laden story that touches on themes of mortality and self, and requires a great deal of work from the director's audience. Movies such as Kubrick's 2001 and Tarkovsky's SOLARIS come to mind as Aronofsky gets deep into philosophical waters, and the various story strands of THE FOUNTAIN are as inconclusive and open to interpretation as the films that have clearly influenced it. The film makes for uneasy and sometimes confusing viewing, but will find its audience among intrepid souls who are fully prepared to let go and immerse themselves in Aronofsky's peculiar, daring, and thoughtful cinematic universe.

            <description>In this near-perfect suspense movie adapted from the popular 1960s television series that starred David Janssen, renowned vascular surgeon Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) has been falsely accused and convicted--on circumstantial evidence--of his wife's (Sela Ward) murder. While Kimble is being transported to prison, another convict stabs an inattentive guard, causing a massive wreck. Kimble escapes but is hunted by tough U.S. marshal Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones). The fugitive from injustice attempts to set the record straight: He transforms himself into a jack-of-all-trades and a man of a thousand faces in a desperate attempt to uncover the truth about his wife's murder and track down the real killer. Spectacular special effects and a pulse-pounding performance by Ford turned Andrew Davis's thrilling film into a blockbuster at the box office, leading to a sequel, U.S. MARSHALS.

            <description>For the follow-up to his dark crime thriller SEVEN, director David Fincher decided to remain in a film noir vein. The result is THE GAME, a fast-paced cinematic roller-coaster ride that stars Michael Douglas as Nicholas Van Orton, a joyless San Francisco investment banker who receives an unusual birthday present from his estranged younger brother, Conrad (Sean Penn). The gift enrolls Nicholas in CRS (Consumer Recreation Services), a company that designs elaborate real-life games for each specific participant. As the game begins, the reluctant Nicholas becomes the victim of a series of pranks that quickly turn malicious and dangerous. Stripped of his finances and convinced that he can trust no one, Nicholas realizes that this game may be an attempt to steal his fortune and leave him for dead. In a desperate bid to regain his life, Nicholas infiltrates CRS in order to uncover the secrets of the mysterious organization.Douglas is perfect playing the uptight businessman Nicholas, cleverly riffing on his Oscar-winning performance as the cold-blooded Gordon Gekko in WALL STREET. Fincher's Kafkaesque carnival show is an exercise in taut filmmaking that mischievously pulls a seemingly endless supply of rugs out from under both Nicholas and, even more impressive, the viewer.

            <description>After the rugged rodeo drama JUNIOR BONNER, the impetuous Sam Peckinpah reteamed with Steve McQueen for this down-and-dirty heist picture. McQueen stars with his soon-to-be real-life bride Ali McGraw (with whom he fell in love during the film's production) as the beautiful, but dangerous, married couple Doc and Carol McCoy. After being released from prison--for reasons Doc would rather not acknowledge--Doc shacks up in a hotel with Carol to plot a small-town bank robbery. Of course, the heist doesn't go as smoothly as planned, resulting in an action-packed journey that sends the lovers on a reckless romp through the beautiful Texas landscape.Peckinpah's big screen adaptation of Jim Thompson's novel features the trademark qualities that helped to make him such an alternately reviled and revered figure: namely, his vision of a world in which even the good guys are bad guys. Lucien Ballard's gorgeous cinematography contrasts wonderfully with the gritty subject matter, lifting the potentially standard picture to a more artistic plateau. The chemistry between the incomparably cool McQueen and the magnetic McGraw also confirms THE GETAWAY's status as a defining film of the genre. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.

            <description>Based on Nicholas Pileggi's book WISEGUY, Martin Scorsese's GOODFELLAS is a wry, violent, and exhilarating film about the life of Henry Hill, an aspiring criminal who ends up in the FBI's witness protection program after testifying against his former partners. As a poor Irish-Italian growing up in 1950s New York City, Hill (Ray Liotta) rises through the ranks of his Brooklyn neighborhood's organized crime branch, and with money from the mob he begins living the good life, complete with a beautiful bride, Karen (Lorraine Bracco), a fancy house, and the best seats at the most exclusive restaurants. A botched robbery lands Henry in prison for a brief period of time, and when he gets released, his reckless infidelities and drug abuse damage his association with his adopted family.Scorsese's film is a visual and sonic onslaught, featuring a brilliant pop-music soundtrack and stunning camera work--including the infamous Steadicam one-take that introduces the audience to the Copacabana's patrons. He uses the songs to infuse a breathtaking, invigorating rhythm into every scene. As the psychopathic Tommy DeVito, Joe Pesci delivers an unforgettable performance that is alarming in its cold-blooded callousness, helping to cement GOODFELLAS' place as a classic portrait of life in the mob.

            <description>GOTHIKA stars Halle Berry as Dr. Miranda Grey, a psychiatrist who becomes a patient in her own mental hospital after she is accused of murdering her husband (Charles S. Dutton). Grey's only initial memory of the incident involves a chilling encounter with a distraught girl (Kathleen Mackey) on a rain-soaked road. The incarcerated and medicated Grey is now haunted by the same apparition, and she must convince her former colleague Pete Graham (Robert Downey Jr.) that she is not insane or guilty of murder. Meanwhile, the seemingly mad ramblings of Chloe (Penelope Cruz), one of Grey's former patients, now make more sense, and Grey must throw aside clinical logic to solve the supernatural murder mystery.Kassovitz, who is already a capable actor (AMELIE) and director (CRIMSON RIVERS), makes the leap to Hollywood filmmaking with GOTHIKA. Drawing from heavily from the Japanese horror renaissance that began with RINGU in the late 1990s, Kassovitz conjures up a forebodingly stark and shadowy tale. Berry continues her remarkable string of success (after her Oscar-winning role in MONSTER'S BALL, along with DIE ANOTHER DAY and X-MEN 2), portraying Grey as a traumatized and vulnerable yet determined woman who must unravel the brutal and bizarre knot of her own lost memory. As Grey's coworker, Downey Jr. adds an intriguing element to the film, and Cruz, as a frustrated inmate, gives an unusual quirky performance. A scare-laden thriller that delights in the strange and the frightening, GOTHIKA proves to be one of the finest of 2003's many horror films. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.

            <description>Set in the strange and beautiful world first explored in the 2005 documentary MARCH OF THE PENGUINS, George Miller's HAPPY FEET tells the story of Mumble (Elijah Wood), a tone-deaf Emperor Penguin who is unable to sing his "heart song," the ritual required to win a mate (in this case, his beloved Gloria, voiced by Brittany Murphy). The fact that Mumble is a terrific tap dancer is completely lost on his tribe, and he spends a rather lonely adolescence as an outsider. His hero's journey involves both discovering his own innate coolness, and, more importantly, solving the mystery of the dwindling supply of edible fish in the ocean. As the latter plot takes over, the film shifts from a touching story of self-belief, to a more urgent ecological plea, but all the themes converge when Mumble's special talent saves the day.The film is a triumph of striking CGI animation, with every frame celebrating the vast and breathtaking purity of Antarctica's tundras, snowscapes, icebergs, and waters, as well as its wildlife. The musical numbers--drawing on pop hits of the last 30 years--were choreographed by Savion Glover, and revel in the joyful if slightly limited physicality of the bottom-heavy penguins. While some scary scenes of predation may be too much for very young children, this is an inspiring tale that is suitable for the whole family. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.

            <description>Set in the strange and beautiful world first explored in the 2005 documentary MARCH OF THE PENGUINS, George Miller's HAPPY FEET tells the story of Mumble (Elijah Wood), a tone-deaf Emperor Penguin who is unable to sing his "heart song," the ritual required to win a mate (in this case, his beloved Gloria, voiced by Brittany Murphy). The fact that Mumble is a terrific tap dancer is completely lost on his tribe, and he spends a rather lonely adolescence as an outsider. His hero's journey involves both discovering his own innate coolness, and, more importantly, solving the mystery of the dwindling supply of edible fish in the ocean. As the latter plot takes over, the film shifts from a touching story of self-belief, to a more urgent ecological plea, but all the themes converge when Mumble's special talent saves the day.The film is a triumph of striking CGI animation, with every frame celebrating the vast and breathtaking purity of Antarctica's tundras, snowscapes, icebergs, and waters, as well as its wildlife. The musical numbers--drawing on pop hits of the last 30 years--were choreographed by Savion Glover, and revel in the joyful if slightly limited physicality of the bottom-heavy penguins. While some scary scenes of predation may be too much for very young children, this is an inspiring tale that is suitable for the whole family. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.

            <description>Here's a gooey, hilarious, creepy horror film for the whole mutant cannibal family. Michael Rooker (HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER) stars as Grant, a big bald guy from a small southern town who gets possessed by a meat-hungry parasite worm creature from space. Even under the alien influence he still loves his wife, Starla (Elizabeth Banks), but she's alarmed at his weird new habits, such as consuming all the local wildlife. The sheriff in town (Nathan Fillion) investigates. He still carries a torch for Starla from when they were kids, but once the squirming, slithering, and cannibalism begin in earnest, it becomes clear that this is no time for romance. SLITHER's combination of interesting characters, deadpan humor, gore aplenty, and genuine scares earns it a place alongside cult classics like RE-ANIMATOR and the various LIVING DEAD and EVIL DEAD films. Director/writer James Gunn wrote 2004's DAWN OF THE DEAD before this, and it's abundantly clear where his loyalties lie: SLITHER aims its acid-dripping, brain-sucking tongue right into the hearts of horror fans. Heads explode, monsters squiggle into gaping mouths, tentacles wrap around Banks's negligee-clad body, and the sheriff takes it all in his stride. There's even a twisted intergalactic love story somewhere in the chaos, as well as hordes of in-jokes for the fans. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.

            <description>Two politically-minded whizkids pull off a daring computer caper in the Sixties, but, by a serendipitous twist of fate, only one of them gets caught. Twenty years later, the lucky half of that daring duo has set himself up in business as the leader of an oddball group of computer hackers who test security systems for big companies. But when agents from the NSA (National Security Agency) catch up with him, he must agree to send his team on a top secret, i.e. illegal, mission to recapture an invaluable decoding device. This powerful "black box" would allow anyone possessing it, including the Russians, the ability to access or alter whatever information they wanted to -- in the entire cyberspace galaxy. But things are not quite as they appear to be, and our aging hero soon realizes he must look into his own past to unlock the biggest secret of all. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.

            <description>Two politically-minded whizkids pull off a daring computer caper in the Sixties, but, by a serendipitous twist of fate, only one of them gets caught. Twenty years later, the lucky half of that daring duo has set himself up in business as the leader of an oddball group of computer hackers who test security systems for big companies. But when agents from the NSA (National Security Agency) catch up with him, he must agree to send his team on a top secret, i.e. illegal, mission to recapture an invaluable decoding device. This powerful "black box" would allow anyone possessing it, including the Russians, the ability to access or alter whatever information they wanted to -- in the entire cyberspace galaxy. But things are not quite as they appear to be, and our aging hero soon realizes he must look into his own past to unlock the biggest secret of all. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.

            <description>SPARTACUS, based on Howard Fast's popular novel, is Stanley Kubrick's glorious masterpiece about a slave uprising in Rome in 70 B.C. Kirk Douglas, who also served as executive producer, stars as the title character, a man born of a slave woman and a slave master who has known nothing but chains his entire life. After being forced to put on a gladiator show--that almost leads to his death--for wealthy Romans (including a marvelously conniving Laurence Olivier as the power-hungry Crassus), Spartacus leads a slave revolt across Italy that soon has thousands marching on Rome. Meanwhile, he has fallen in love with the beautiful Varinia (an effervescent Jean Simmons), pledging his life to her.Douglas assembled a fabulous all-star cast for the film; in addition to himself, Simmons, and Olivier, terrific performances are turned in by Charles Laughton as the curmudgeonly senator Gracchus, John Gavin as the young Julius Caesar, Tony Curtis as Antoninus (a "singer of songs," with all lines delivered in a beautifully thick New York accent), and especially Peter Ustinov, an Oscar winner for his portrayal of the businessman Batiatus, who always wants to know what's in it for him. Blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo's melodramatic script and Alex North's thrilling, soaring score add a majesty that helps make SPARTACUS one of the finest costume epics to ever come out of Hollywood.

            <description>This high-action flight movie centers on a team of three sexy stealth bomber pilots who are forced to fly with EDI (Extreme Deep Invader), a computer-manned prototype plane that specializes in extra-precision bombing. The brainchild of a Bill Gates-esque wunderkind (Richard Roxburgh), EDI has the ability to learn at a fantastic rate, talks like HAL from 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY, and likes to listen to hard rock before going into combat. Before long, a freak accident causes it to question authority and launch an attack on Russia. W.D. Richter's script probes big issues involving man, machine, and the nuclear fate of the free world (Read: DR. STRANGELOVE meets THE TERMINATOR). But this is also an action thrill ride from Rob Cohen--the man responsible for THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS and XXX--replete with some truly tremendous explosions and speeds that outdo any mph records set in Cohen's past ouevre. Jessica Biel (TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE) is tough and surprisingly believable as the token female fighter pilot, while Jamie Foxx (RAY) makes a fine wingman to the daredevil squadron leader played by Josh Lucas. Sam Shephard (THE RIGHT STUFF) is their commanding officer, with Joe Morton playing a shady politician. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

            <description>This high-action flight movie centers on a team of three sexy stealth bomber pilots who are forced to fly with EDI (Extreme Deep Invader), a computer-manned prototype plane that specializes in extra-precision bombing. The brainchild of a Bill Gates-esque wunderkind (Richard Roxburgh), EDI has the ability to learn at a fantastic rate, talks like HAL from 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY, and likes to listen to hard rock before going into combat. Before long, a freak accident causes it to question authority and launch an attack on Russia. W.D. Richter's script probes big issues involving man, machine, and the nuclear fate of the free world (Read: DR. STRANGELOVE meets THE TERMINATOR). But this is also an action thrill ride from Rob Cohen--the man responsible for THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS and XXX--replete with some truly tremendous explosions and speeds that outdo any mph records set in Cohen's past ouevre. Jessica Biel (TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE) is tough and surprisingly believable as the token female fighter pilot, while Jamie Foxx (RAY) makes a fine wingman to the daredevil squadron leader played by Josh Lucas. Sam Shephard (THE RIGHT STUFF) is their commanding officer, with Joe Morton playing a shady politician. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

            <description>Hoping that box-office lighting might strike twice, George Roy Hill again joined forces with Paul Newman and Robert Redford, who star as con men Henry Gondorff and Johnny Hooker in THE STING. In the Chicago of the 1930s, Johnny's partner, Luther (Robert Earl Jones), is fatally wounded by a victim of one of their scams who turns out to be powerful syndicate boss Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw). Eager for revenge, Johnny takes a tip from his dying partner and seeks out mutual friend Gondorff, a consummate master of the long con. Gondorff rouses himself from his alcoholic inertia and agrees to help Johnny take down the despicable Lonnegan, conscripting an army of grifters ready to avenge their friend's death. The labyrinthine plot, which is stuffed with false leads, red herrings, and a double-cross-a-minute, involves a fake bookie joint, a very persistent FBI agent, a bunch of corrupt cops, and one shifty dame. An extremely entertaining film, the Oscar-winning film transcends the genre through the superb acting of the three leads, the keen attention to the re-creation of period detail, and a fiendishly intricate script that cons audiences completely. The wonderful score, which became immensely popular, featured Marvin Hamlisch's orchestral transcriptions of Scott Joplin's piano rags; the film led to a revival of interest in the composer. The film is one of the most entertaining films of the 1970s and lives up to its hype on repeat viewings. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

            <description>Star John Travolta revisits the grinning villain territory he explored in BROKEN ARROW and FACE/OFF with this stylish, supercharged techno-thriller. He plays Gabriel, a charismatic, fast-living mystery man who, with help from his right-hand woman, Ginger (Halle Berry), recruits ex-con and former master hacker Stan (Hugh Jackman) to aid in a plan to steal billions from a secret government bank account. Stan reluctantly agrees to help in order to finance the legal battle for custody of his young daughter (Camryn Grimes). Meanwhile an FBI computer crimes specialist (Don Cheadle) is determined to find out what's about to go down, and plans to use Stan to find out.The movie amply earns its keep by cleverly zig-zagging away from audience's expectations and delivering many clever, pulse-pounding action set pieces--including an incredible opening explosion, a car chase through downtown Los Angeles replete with blazing machine guns, and a spectacular airborne climax. With the help of a propulsive electronica score by DJ Paul Okenfold, director Dominic Sena (GONE IN 60 SECONDS) lays down lots of style, and Travolta is mesmerizing in his juicy role.

            <description>Stephen Gaghan, who won an Oscar for best screenplay for TRAFFIC, makes his directorial debut with SYRIANA, an espionage thriller set in the Middle East. George Clooney stars as Bob Barnes, a longtime CIA agent preparing to slow down his life and spend more time with his teenage son (Max Minghella). But his last secret mission, getting rid of Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig), turns out to be more complicated than he imagined, placing him in the middle of a dangerous conspiracy involving government corruption, oil, and international terrorism. Matt Damon, who starred with Clooney in OCEAN'S ELEVEN and OCEAN'S TWELVE (and made a cameo in Clooney's CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND, which was also about spies and conspiracies), plays Bryan Woodman, an energy executive whose ethics become vulnerable after the horrific loss of one of his sons. Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., lawyers Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) and Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer) also must choose between the government's special interests and what's best for the world (as well as their own special interests). Gaghan gives SYRIANA a documentary-like feel, using handheld cameras and shooting on location, adding to the believability of the complex plot. To heighten the realism, Clooney learned to speak Arabic and even put on 30 pounds for the role. A fast-paced, heart-pounding, relentless film, SYRIANA was inspired by the true story of former CIA agent Robert Baer, told in his book SEE NO EVIL: THE TRUE STORY OF A GROUND SOLDIER IN THE CIA'S WAR ON TERRORISM.

            <description>Stephen Gaghan, who won an Oscar for best screenplay for TRAFFIC, makes his directorial debut with SYRIANA, an espionage thriller set in the Middle East. George Clooney stars as Bob Barnes, a longtime CIA agent preparing to slow down his life and spend more time with his teenage son (Max Minghella). But his last secret mission, getting rid of Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig), turns out to be more complicated than he imagined, placing him in the middle of a dangerous conspiracy involving government corruption, oil, and international terrorism. Matt Damon, who starred with Clooney in OCEAN'S ELEVEN and OCEAN'S TWELVE (and made a cameo in Clooney's CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND, which was also about spies and conspiracies), plays Bryan Woodman, an energy executive whose ethics become vulnerable after the horrific loss of one of his sons. Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., lawyers Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) and Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer) also must choose between the government's special interests and what's best for the world (as well as their own special interests). Gaghan gives SYRIANA a documentary-like feel, using handheld cameras and shooting on location, adding to the believability of the complex plot. To heighten the realism, Clooney learned to speak Arabic and even put on 30 pounds for the role. A fast-paced, heart-pounding, relentless film, SYRIANA was inspired by the true story of former CIA agent Robert Baer, told in his book SEE NO EVIL: THE TRUE STORY OF A GROUND SOLDIER IN THE CIA'S WAR ON TERRORISM.

            <description>Based on both the short story by John W. Campbell, Jr. and the 1951 film produced by Howard Hawks, THE THING is John Carpenter's stunning masterpiece of horror. A group of weary scientists enduring the winter in an isolated camp deep in Antarctica chance upon an alien spacecraft buried in the ice. Near the strange craft is the body of an alien being, frozen solid. Thinking they have made the find of a lifetime, the scientists bring the alien body back to camp and thaw it out. The alien awakens, not in the best of moods, and proceeds to take over the identities of the scientists, one by one, body and all. Helicopter pilot MacCready (Kurt Russell) must lead the surviving men in discovering who among them is human and who is not and how they can destroy "the thing" before it takes them all and moves on to the heavily populated mainland and the rest of humanity. Rob Bottin supplies the awe-inspiring special effects of the creature in its many, ever-changing forms. The effects were groundbreaking at the time and hold up flawlessly over the passing years. But Carpenter does not rely solely on special effects, utilizing his spectacular cast, which includes Wilford Brimley and Richard Dysart, to create three dimensional characters enduring an unthinkable situation. The score from Ennio Morricone is understated, yet increases the tense mood tenfold. Shooting was difficult and done in below freezing conditions, but despite the discomfort the cast and crew produced a truly terrifying film that will stand the test of time. THE THING is surely one of Carpenter's definitive films and a true horror classic. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

THE THING is surely one of Carpenter's definitive films and a true horror classic. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

            <description>Based on both the short story by John W. Campbell, Jr. and the 1951 film produced by Howard Hawks, THE THING is John Carpenter's stunning masterpiece of horror. A group of weary scientists enduring the winter in an isolated camp deep in Antarctica chance upon an alien spacecraft buried in the ice. Near the strange craft is the body of an alien being, frozen solid. Thinking they have made the find of a lifetime, the scientists bring the alien body back to camp and thaw it out. The alien awakens, not in the best of moods, and proceeds to take over the identities of the scientists, one by one, body and all. Helicopter pilot MacCready (Kurt Russell) must lead the surviving men in discovering who among them is human and who is not and how they can destroy "the thing" before it takes them all and moves on to the heavily populated mainland and the rest of humanity. Rob Bottin supplies the awe-inspiring special effects of the creature in its many, ever-changing forms. The effects were groundbreaking at the time and hold up flawlessly over the passing years. But Carpenter does not rely solely on special effects, utilizing his spectacular cast, which includes Wilford Brimley and Richard Dysart, to create three dimensional characters enduring an unthinkable situation. The score from Ennio Morricone is understated, yet increases the tense mood tenfold. Shooting was difficult and done in below freezing conditions, but despite the discomfort the cast and crew produced a truly terrifying film that will stand the test of time.

            <description>Director and screenwriter Kevin Munroe brings the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to the 21st century with TMNT. This animated film--made with computer-generated imagery (CGI)--finds the four genetically mutated, pizza-loving turtles a less than coherent family unit: Leonardo (James Arnold Taylor) is in Central America, training to be a better leader; Donatello (Mitchell Whitfield) is manning an IT help desk; Michelangelo (Mikey Kelly) is making the children's party circuit as an entertainer; and Raphael (Nolan North) is secretly spending his nights as the city's resident vigilante. Leonardo's return fails to unite them; in fact, it only increases his brother Raphael's resentment. But when monsters begin appearing in New York City and are pursued by both the mysterious Foot Clan (another group of crackerjack Ninjas) and some menacing stone statues that have come to life, the brothers must band together under the tutelage of their sensei, a mutated rat named Master Splinter (Mako), and fight for their city.Sarah Michelle Gellar voices April, an archaeologist and friend of the turtles; her beau, Casey, is voiced by Chris Evans. Patrick Stewart, Laurence Fishburne, Ziyi Zhang, and Kevin Smith also provide voices for the film. Fans of the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, created in 1984 by Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman as a spoof on superheroes, will appreciate the advances of CGI technology. The story focuses largely on issues faced by real families, but there is still plenty of action. From skateboarding in sewers and bounding across rooftops to using their Ninja training against threatening monsters, the Turtles prove they are back with a vengeance and ready to take on anything.

            <description>In Guillermo del Toro's BLADE II, Wesley Snipes reprises his role as the part-human, part-vampire superhero based on the comic book character. Following a trail of blood that leads to Prague, Blade (aka the Daywalker) slays a legion of bloodsuckers in the search for his abducted mentor, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson). Soon Blade reluctantly joins forces with a band of skilled vampiric warriors called the Bloodpack to hunt down an even deadlier enemy--the monstrous Reapers, who prey on vampires and humans alike, infecting them with an incurable virus. In addition to battling these relentless new foes, Blade must deal with situations brought about by the Bloodpack's tenuous alliance --in particular, his attraction to the lovely Nyssa (Leonor Varela) and his rivalry with the brutish Reinhardt (Ron Perlman).A hyperkinetic motion picture, BLADE II literally explodes onto the screen with hi-tech weaponry and stunning special effects. The fight sequences, choreographed by Hong Kong superstar Donnie Yen (who plays Bloodpack member Snowman), are remarkably hard-hitting and elaborate. The film also improves on the entertaining original by adding a darker, more visceral tone that's fleshed out by del Toro's stylish and brilliantly grotesque visuals. Both frightening and thrilling, BLADE II is sure to astound both horror and action fans alike. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

            <description>A madcap spoof of the classic Hollywood Western, BLAZING SADDLES is also one of the most gleefully anti-P.C. films ever produced by a major studio. When the sheriff of a small frontier town is killed, convict Bart (Cleavon Little) is appointed the first black sheriff of all-white Rock Ridge by the evil Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman), who hopes this will chase the townspeople from their homes. The naive Sheriff Bart soon catches on, realizing from the less than cheery welcome that the townspeople (who all seem to be named Johnson) aren't prepared for a black sheriff and that he was never meant to succeed at all.  Enlisting the help of the sensitive town drunk (Gene Wilder), formerly the Waco Kid, Bart embarks on a plan to save Rock Ridge. A scathing spoof that deals with racism, sexism, and bodily functions, BLAZING SADDLES offers a contrast between picture and words that is shocking, subversive, and hilarious. Director Mel Brooks makes two memorable appearances--as both the sleazy governor and a Yiddish-speaking Sioux Indian chief--while Madeline Kahn does a sidesplitting Marlene Dietrich imitation as the town floozy. Featuring fabulous comic turns by Alex Karras and Slim Pickens, BLAZING SADDLES is raunchy, lovable, and uproarious. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.

            <description>A madcap spoof of the classic Hollywood Western, BLAZING SADDLES is also one of the most gleefully anti-P.C. films ever produced by a major studio. When the sheriff of a small frontier town is killed, convict Bart (Cleavon Little) is appointed the first black sheriff of all-white Rock Ridge by the evil Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman), who hopes this will chase the townspeople from their homes. The naive Sheriff Bart soon catches on, realizing from the less than cheery welcome that the townspeople (who all seem to be named Johnson) aren't prepared for a black sheriff and that he was never meant to succeed at all.  Enlisting the help of the sensitive town drunk (Gene Wilder), formerly the Waco Kid, Bart embarks on a plan to save Rock Ridge. A scathing spoof that deals with racism, sexism, and bodily functions, BLAZING SADDLES offers a contrast between picture and words that is shocking, subversive, and hilarious. Director Mel Brooks makes two memorable appearances--as both the sleazy governor and a Yiddish-speaking Sioux Indian chief--while Madeline Kahn does a sidesplitting Marlene Dietrich imitation as the town floozy. Featuring fabulous comic turns by Alex Karras and Slim Pickens, BLAZING SADDLES is raunchy, lovable, and uproarious. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.

            <description>Based on the true-life exploits of notorious Depression-era bank robbers Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow, BONNIE AND CLYDE is recognized as one of the most violent films to come out of mainstream Hollywood. Bonnie (Faye Dunaway) is bored with life and wants a change. She gets her chance when she meets a charming young drifter by the name of Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty). Clyde has dreams of a life of crime that will free him from the hardships of the Depression. The two fall in love and begin a crime spree that extends from Oklahoma to Texas. They rob small banks with skill and panache, soon becoming minor celebrities known across the country. People are proud to have been held up by Bonnie and Clyde; to their victims, the duo is doing what nobody else has the guts to do. To the law, the two are evil bank robbers who deserve to be gunned down where they stand. Beatty and Dunaway are marvelous as the young criminal lovers, delivering subtle and complete performances. Also excellent are Gene Hackman as Clyde's brother, Buck; Estelle Parsons as Buck's wife, Blanche; and the always enjoyable Michael J. Pollard as C.W. Moss. The film has made a large impact on American culture, expressing the mood of rebellion rampant in the late 1960s and beyond. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.

            <description>Based on the true-life exploits of notorious Depression-era bank robbers Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow, BONNIE AND CLYDE is recognized as one of the most violent films to come out of mainstream Hollywood. Bonnie (Faye Dunaway) is bored with life and wants a change. She gets her chance when she meets a charming young drifter by the name of Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty). Clyde has dreams of a life of crime that will free him from the hardships of the Depression. The two fall in love and begin a crime spree that extends from Oklahoma to Texas. They rob small banks with skill and panache, soon becoming minor celebrities known across the country. People are proud to have been held up by Bonnie and Clyde; to their victims, the duo is doing what nobody else has the guts to do. To the law, the two are evil bank robbers who deserve to be gunned down where they stand. Beatty and Dunaway are marvelous as the young criminal lovers, delivering subtle and complete performances. Also excellent are Gene Hackman as Clyde's brother, Buck; Estelle Parsons as Buck's wife, Blanche; and the always enjoyable Michael J. Pollard as C.W. Moss. The film has made a large impact on American culture, expressing the mood of rebellion rampant in the late 1960s and beyond. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.

            <description>Director Neil Jordan (THE CRYING GAME) injects the standard revenge saga with new life by asking difficult questions about the meaning of courage in his thriller THE BRAVE ONE. Jodi Foster (THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, INSIDE MAN) showcases her knack for playing characters with a mix of strength and vulnerability, while Terrence Howard's tender charisma comes through IN Mercer, the cop who knows more than he's letting on. Foster plays New Yorker Erica Bain, a radio talk show host happily engaged to a doctor (Naveen Andrews, LOST). The walls of Erica's safe existence come tumbling down one night during a walk through Central Park with her boyfriend, during which they are mugged, he is killed, and she is severely beaten. When she wakes from a coma three weeks later, Erica's eyes assume a haunted look and she fears the city she once loved. So she buys a gun, and when she witnesses a domestic fight and murder in an all-night convenience store, she uses it to save herself. This first murder opens the door to others, as Erica takes to the streets at night, baiting criminals and extracting her revenge. Her vigilante actions become sensationalized in the media, while her talk show becomes a platform from which to explore her new feelings about New York, the "safest big city in the world." Detective Mercer, who was assigned to Erica's original case, begins to put the pieces together as the bond between the two grows stronger. THE BRAVE ONE is a gritty, engaging, and well-crafted thriller that relies on strongly developed characters, rather than action and violence, to carry a story that makes no easy assumptions about the definitions of good and evil.

            <description>Chris Cooper (ADAPTATION) gives a remarkable performance as complicated and bitter FBI agent Robert Hanssen in BREACH. Hanssen is a computer specialist who, after 25 years of service, is put under surveillance as a suspected sex offender. Eric O'Neill (Ryan Phillippe, CRASH) is the ambitious young upstart they put on the job, assigning him to pose as Hanssen's new clerk in order to win his trust and keep an eye on his every move. Eric is dismayed to be put on such low-priority detail, accustomed as he is to investigating high-profile terrorism suspects. His reluctance is multiplied as he gets to know the subject of his inquiry; Hanssen is at first harsh towards his young secretary, but as he opens up, Eric gets to know and respect him as a family man of strong Catholic faith. Soon, however, Hanssen is infiltrating Eric's personal life and causing problems between him and his wife, Juliana (Caroline Dhavernas, HOLLYWOODLAND), and just when Eric is about to give up the case, he discovers that it is much bigger than he ever imagined. Eric finds himself in the middle of an investigation into the biggest security breach in U.S. history, forcing him to resort to dramatic and ingenious tactics in order to bring down the suspect. Director Billy Ray's first directorial effort was the dramatization of the Stephen Glass scandal at the D.C. magazine The New Republic in SHATTERED GLASS, and here he once again turns his eye--with great success--to a true story with a complex villain. Cooper's excellent characterization invites pity and horror in equal measure; his performance is well supported in this character-driven thriller by Laura Linney (KINSEY) as the hard-nosed agent leading the investigation, and Phillippe as the resourceful and introspective O'Neill.

            <description>Chris Cooper (ADAPTATION) gives a remarkable performance as complicated and bitter FBI agent Robert Hanssen in BREACH. Hanssen is a computer specialist who, after 25 years of service, is put under surveillance as a suspected sex offender. Eric O'Neill (Ryan Phillippe, CRASH) is the ambitious young upstart they put on the job, assigning him to pose as Hanssen's new clerk in order to win his trust and keep an eye on his every move. Eric is dismayed to be put on such low-priority detail, accustomed as he is to investigating high-profile terrorism suspects. His reluctance is multiplied as he gets to know the subject of his inquiry; Hanssen is at first harsh towards his young secretary, but as he opens up, Eric gets to know and respect him as a family man of strong Catholic faith. Soon, however, Hanssen is infiltrating Eric's personal life and causing problems between him and his wife, Juliana (Caroline Dhavernas, HOLLYWOODLAND), and just when Eric is about to give up the case, he discovers that it is much bigger than he ever imagined. Eric finds himself in the middle of an investigation into the biggest security breach in U.S. history, forcing him to resort to dramatic and ingenious tactics in order to bring down the suspect. Director Billy Ray's first directorial effort was the dramatization of the Stephen Glass scandal at the D.C. magazine The New Republic in SHATTERED GLASS, and here he once again turns his eye--with great success--to a true story with a complex villain. Cooper's excellent characterization invites pity and horror in equal measure; his performance is well supported in this character-driven thriller by Laura Linney (KINSEY) as the hard-nosed agent leading the investigation, and Phillippe as the resourceful and introspective O'Neill.

            <description>In one of his most memorable roles, Steve McQueen stars as Detective Frank Bullitt, a hard-driving, tough-as-nails San Francisco cop. Bullitt has just received what sounds like a routine assignment: keep a star witness out of sight and out of danger for 48 hours, then deliver him to the courtroom on Monday morning. But before the night is out, the witness will lie dying of shotgun wounds, and Bullitt, a no-glitter, all-guts cop, won't rest until he nabs the gunmen and the elusive underworld kingpin who hired them.From opening shot to closing shootout, Peter Yates's edge-of-the seat thriller is packed with authentic touches, from on-location San Francisco filming and believably crisp dialogue to uncompromisingly detailed police, hospital, and morgue procedures. The most memorable scene is BULLITT's celebrated car chase. McQueen, an expert automobile and motorcycle racer, does his own stunt driving as he propels his high-performance Mustang GT around and over San Francisco's fabled hills at speeds up to 115 miles an hour. The film is based on Robert L. Pike's book, MUTE WITNESS. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

Bullitt has just received what sounds like a routine assignment: keep a star witness out of sight and out of danger for 48 hours, then deliver him to the courtroom on Monday morning. But before the night is out, the witness will lie dying of shotgun wounds, and Bullitt, a no-glitter, all-guts cop, won't rest until he nabs the gunmen and the elusive underworld kingpin who hired them.From opening shot to closing shootout, Peter Yates's edge-of-the seat thriller is packed with authentic touches, from on-location San Francisco filming and believably crisp dialogue to uncompromisingly detailed police, hospital, and morgue procedures. The most memorable scene is BULLITT's celebrated car chase. McQueen, an expert automobile and motorcycle racer, does his own stunt driving as he propels his high-performance Mustang GT around and over San Francisco's fabled hills at speeds up to 115 miles an hour. The film is based on Robert L. Pike's book, MUTE WITNESS. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

            <description>Harold Ramis's directorial debut is a hysterical farce set at the typically hoity-toity Bushwood County club. A send-up of the typical class struggle, it pits the caddies against the establishment with riotous results. This wacky comedy features insanely funny performances from Bill Murray, as the local groundskeeper obsessed with killing off the gophers who are infesting the golf course, as well as Chevy Chase as a wealthy antiestablishment member of Bushwood and Rodney Dangerfield, who shines as a land-shark real estate mogul who couldn't care less about the rules and regulations at the snobby club.

            <description>Harold Ramis's directorial debut is a hysterical farce set at the typically hoity-toity Bushwood County club. A send-up of the typical class struggle, it pits the caddies against the establishment with riotous results. This wacky comedy features insanely funny performances from Bill Murray, as the local groundskeeper obsessed with killing off the gophers who are infesting the golf course, as well as Chevy Chase as a wealthy antiestablishment member of Bushwood and Rodney Dangerfield, who shines as a land-shark real estate mogul who couldn't care less about the rules and regulations at the snobby club.

            <description>World War II Morocco springs to life in Michael Curtiz's (THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, YANKEE DOODLE DANDY) classic love story. Colorful characters abound in Casablanca, a waiting room for Europeans trying to escape Hitler's war-torn Europe.  Humphrey Bogart plays Richard "Rick" Blaine, a cynical but good-hearted American whose cafÃ© is the gathering place for everyone from the French Police to the black market to the Nazis. When his long-lost love, Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), surfaces in Casablanca with her Resistance leader husband, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), Rick is pulled into both a love triangle and a web of political intrigue. Ilsa and Victor need to escape from Casablanca, and Rick may be the only one who can help them. The question is, will he? Top-notch performances include Claude Rains as the chief of the French police and the major authority figure in Unoccupied France, Peter Lorre as the doomed Senor Ugarte, Sydney Greenstreet as Senor Ferrari, and Dooley Wilson as Rick's loyal friend and the cafÃ©'s pianist, Sam.  The mesmerizing musical score, by Max Steiner, along with the well-structured plot, flawless acting, and unforgettable dialogue makes this one of the best films of all time.

            <description>World War II Morocco springs to life in Michael Curtiz's (THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, YANKEE DOODLE DANDY) classic love story. Colorful characters abound in Casablanca, a waiting room for Europeans trying to escape Hitler's war-torn Europe.  Humphrey Bogart plays Richard "Rick" Blaine, a cynical but good-hearted American whose cafÃ© is the gathering place for everyone from the French Police to the black market to the Nazis. When his long-lost love, Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), surfaces in Casablanca with her Resistance leader husband, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), Rick is pulled into both a love triangle and a web of political intrigue. Ilsa and Victor need to escape from Casablanca, and Rick may be the only one who can help them. The question is, will he? Top-notch performances include Claude Rains as the chief of the French police and the major authority figure in Unoccupied France, Peter Lorre as the doomed Senor Ugarte, Sydney Greenstreet as Senor Ferrari, and Dooley Wilson as Rick's loyal friend and the cafÃ©'s pianist, Sam.  The mesmerizing musical score, by Max Steiner, along with the well-structured plot, flawless acting, and unforgettable dialogue makes this one of the best films of all time.

            <description>Martin Scorsese, one of America's most influential filmmakers, returns to the world of mobsters, greed, and excess that he explored so compellingly in 1990's GOODFELLAS. Set in the 1970s and reveling in the minute details of how Las Vegas casinos operate, the film chronicles the rise and fall of casino manager Ace Rothstein (Robert De Niro). As the king of his domain, Ace efficiently runs the business and regularly sends lots of cold cash to his bosses. Helping him keep the casino's employees and customers honest is his best friend, Nicky (Joe Pesci), a violent sociopath. Although Ace aims to run a relatively respectable casino, the volatile Nicky wants to take over the entire gambling mecca, and when Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone), a seasoned Vegas hustler, enters the picture, Ace and Nicky's friendship is complicated even further. As drugs and alcohol become a bigger part of Ginger's life, all three are eventually brought down by their own greed and blind ambition. CASINO shares many similarities with GOODFELLAS, beginning with a script that was cowritten by Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi. Regulars De Niro and Pesci are first rate once again as the dissimilar companions, but it is Stone who steals the show with her grueling, intense performance. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.

            <description>Martin Scorsese, one of America's most influential filmmakers, returns to the world of mobsters, greed, and excess that he explored so compellingly in 1990's GOODFELLAS. Set in the 1970s and reveling in the minute details of how Las Vegas casinos operate, the film chronicles the rise and fall of casino manager Ace Rothstein (Robert De Niro). As the king of his domain, Ace efficiently runs the business and regularly sends lots of cold cash to his bosses. Helping him keep the casino's employees and customers honest is his best friend, Nicky (Joe Pesci), a violent sociopath. Although Ace aims to run a relatively respectable casino, the volatile Nicky wants to take over the entire gambling mecca, and when Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone), a seasoned Vegas hustler, enters the picture, Ace and Nicky's friendship is complicated even further. As drugs and alcohol become a bigger part of Ginger's life, all three are eventually brought down by their own greed and blind ambition. CASINO shares many similarities with GOODFELLAS, beginning with a script that was cowritten by Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi. Regulars De Niro and Pesci are first rate once again as the dissimilar companions, but it is Stone who steals the show with her grueling, intense performance. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.

            <description>This vignette-laden, nostalgic view of Christmastime in 1940s Indiana follows nine-year-old Ralphie, who desperately wants a Red Ryder BB Gun for Christmas--and is waging an all-out campaign to convince his reluctant parents that the toy will be safe in his hands. By turns warped and winsome, the comedy follows Ralphie as he prepares for the big day with his rather idiosyncratic family. Based on the novel by humorist Jean Shepherd (who also narrates the film), A CHRISTMAS STORY gained popularity long after its theatrical run, through frequent holiday broadcasts that turned its schoolyard "triple-dog" dares, family neuroses, and childhood indignities into a Yuletide tradition.

            <description>This vignette-laden, nostalgic view of Christmastime in 1940s Indiana follows nine-year-old Ralphie, who desperately wants a Red Ryder BB Gun for Christmas--and is waging an all-out campaign to convince his reluctant parents that the toy will be safe in his hands. By turns warped and winsome, the comedy follows Ralphie as he prepares for the big day with his rather idiosyncratic family. Based on the novel by humorist Jean Shepherd (who also narrates the film), A CHRISTMAS STORY gained popularity long after its theatrical run, through frequent holiday broadcasts that turned its schoolyard "triple-dog" dares, family neuroses, and childhood indignities into a Yuletide tradition.

            <description>The sequel to cult sci-fi hit PITCH BLACK sees Vin Diesel enthusiastically returning to his role as Richard B. Riddick. Director-writer David Twohy is on board again, building on themes established in the first movie, and expanding his vision with some incredible special effects work. Twohy opens the movie with Riddick on the run from a group of bounty hunters. He escapes them with ease, then seeks information from an old friend named Inam (Keith David). Inam informs Riddick that he has been singled out by an Air Elemental, Aereon (Judi Dench), as the one man who can stop the evil Necromongers from taking over the Universe. Suddenly, the Necromongers arrive on the planet, causing mayhem and destruction. They capture Riddick. He soon escapes, only to fall into the hands of the bounty hunters he so deftly eluded at the start of the movie. They take Riddick to a rogue prison planet where he is met by scorching heat, an underground penitentiary, and his female companion from PITCH BLACK, Jack (who is now called Kyra, and played by a different actress, Alexa Davalos). They plan their escape from the planet, and vow to bring down the Necromongers. Things don't go according to plan however, leading to a suspense-filled climax to the film, and an eyebrow-raising ending that suggests Twohy may have plans for further installments in the story.

            <description>The sequel to cult sci-fi hit PITCH BLACK sees Vin Diesel enthusiastically returning to his role as Richard B. Riddick. Director-writer David Twohy is on board again, building on themes established in the first movie, and expanding his vision with some incredible special effects work. Twohy opens the movie with Riddick on the run from a group of bounty hunters. He escapes them with ease, then seeks information from an old friend named Inam (Keith David). Inam informs Riddick that he has been singled out by an Air Elemental, Aereon (Judi Dench), as the one man who can stop the evil Necromongers from taking over the Universe. Suddenly, the Necromongers arrive on the planet, causing mayhem and destruction. They capture Riddick. He soon escapes, only to fall into the hands of the bounty hunters he so deftly eluded at the start of the movie. They take Riddick to a rogue prison planet where he is met by scorching heat, an underground penitentiary, and his female companion from PITCH BLACK, Jack (who is now called Kyra, and played by a different actress, Alexa Davalos). They plan their escape from the planet, and vow to bring down the Necromongers. Things don't go according to plan however, leading to a suspense-filled climax to the film, and an eyebrow-raising ending that suggests Twohy may have plans for further installments in the story.

            <description>Given his associations with Def Jux's El-P and his 10-year presence in the hip-hop underground, rapper Murs has plenty of cred to his name. His 2006 release, MURRAY'S REVENGE, is one of his most assured, and finds the MC balancing his experimental tendencies with more mainstream hip-hop. With help from producer 9th Wonder, Murs lays down rhymes that address topics that, while standard for rap, are treated with an intelligence and sense of wit not often found in the mainstream.

            <description>Given his associations with Def Jux's El-P and his 10-year presence in the hip-hop underground, rapper Murs has plenty of cred to his name. His 2006 release, MURRAY'S REVENGE, is one of his most assured, and finds the MC balancing his experimental tendencies with more mainstream hip-hop. With help from producer 9th Wonder, Murs lays down rhymes that address topics that, while standard for rap, are treated with an intelligence and sense of wit not often found in the mainstream.

            <description>Start the collection early with this presentation, a collection of lullabies, nursery rhymes, and animation. Combining four short children's favorites, this compilation provides cute and educational entertainment for developing minds. Included are "Rhymin' Time" with Phylicia Rashad offering hip representations of nursery rhymes, "Storytime" in which Arlo Guthrie tells eleven classic short stories, "Singing Time" which features Judy Collins singing Ernest Troost arrangements of popular kids' songs, and "Bedtime" in which Collins and a 14-piece orchestra lull children to sleep with beautiful songs.

            <description>In the years since his novel DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP? was brought to the screen as BLADE RUNNER (1982), Philip K. Dick's paranoid, futuristic works have frequently made the same leap---sometimes as brainy puzzlers (OPEN YOUR EYES, A SCANNER DARKLY), but more often as star-powered action vehicles (TOTAL RECALL, PAYCHECK). NEXT (based very loosely on Dick's short story "The Golden Man") falls squarely in the latter category, with always-game Nicolas Cage as Cris Johnson, a man with the ability to see two minutes into the future. Afraid that all sorts of frightening demands will be made on him if the true scope of his ability becomes known, Johnson limits the use of his powers to a hokey, third-rate Vegas stage show and reading slot machines to gauge their payouts. Meanwhile, terrorists have imported a nuclear device into the U.S., with the intention of detonating it in a major metropolitan area, and F.B.I. agent Callie Ferris (Julianne Moore) has discovered that Cris's ability is no fake and that he might be able to prevent the disaster. Unfortunately for Cris, he has just met Liz Cooper (Jessica Biel), a gorgeous schoolteacher who gets more involved in this international intrigue than she had any intention to.Lee Tamahori (DIE ANOTHER DAY) keeps NEXT's action coming at an admirable clip, fully exploiting the film's gimmick of several possible outcomes to every major crossroads that Cris encounters. Enough things explode, drive fast, and roll down hillsides to satiate any action fan looking for a well-oiled thrill machine. Cage and Moore are their usual likeable screen personas, Biel's Liz Cooper is a suitably crushworthy romantic interest, and Mark Isham's (CRASH, THE BLACK DAHLIA) score provides perfect accompaniment to the proceedings.

            <description>In the years since his novel DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP? was brought to the screen as BLADE RUNNER (1982), Philip K. Dick's paranoid, futuristic works have frequently made the same leap---sometimes as brainy puzzlers (OPEN YOUR EYES, A SCANNER DARKLY), but more often as star-powered action vehicles (TOTAL RECALL, PAYCHECK). NEXT (based very loosely on Dick's short story "The Golden Man") falls squarely in the latter category, with always-game Nicolas Cage as Cris Johnson, a man with the ability to see two minutes into the future. Afraid that all sorts of frightening demands will be made on him if the true scope of his ability becomes known, Johnson limits the use of his powers to a hokey, third-rate Vegas stage show and reading slot machines to gauge their payouts. Meanwhile, terrorists have imported a nuclear device into the U.S., with the intention of detonating it in a major metropolitan area, and F.B.I. agent Callie Ferris (Julianne Moore) has discovered that Cris's ability is no fake and that he might be able to prevent the disaster. Unfortunately for Cris, he has just met Liz Cooper (Jessica Biel), a gorgeous schoolteacher who gets more involved in this international intrigue than she had any intention to.Lee Tamahori (DIE ANOTHER DAY) keeps NEXT's action coming at an admirable clip, fully exploiting the film's gimmick of several possible outcomes to every major crossroads that Cris encounters. Enough things explode, drive fast, and roll down hillsides to satiate any action fan looking for a well-oiled thrill machine. Cage and Moore are their usual likeable screen personas, Biel's Liz Cooper is a suitably crushworthy romantic interest, and Mark Isham's (CRASH, THE BLACK DAHLIA) score provides perfect accompaniment to the proceedings.

            <description>Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhart are charming in the romantic comedy NO RESERVATIONS. Zeta-Jones stars as Kate, an executive chef at a popular restaurant in New York City's Greenwich Village. She is so dedicated to her job that she has no time for a personal life; she even brings gourmet cuisine to her therapist (Bob Balaban), feeding him food rather than opening up her soul. But her life changes when her sister dies in a car accident, leaving Kate to take care of her sister's young daughter, Zoe (Abigail Breslin, from LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE). Suddenly, Kate is responsible for more than just fancy dishes; she is responsible for another human being, which confounds her. After taking a few days off, she returns to her kitchen, only to find that the restaurant owner, Paula (Patricia Clarkson), has hired another chef to assist Kate, a playful, talkative, talented man named Nick (Aaron Eckhart) who likes listening to opera while he works (Kate considers that a major distraction) and so wins over the rest of the staff that Kate feels threatened. But deep down, she also feels a little attracted by the attention Nick pours on her. However, Kate is not sure she can mix being a mother, a master chef, and, perhaps, a lover. NO RESERVATIONS, based on the award-winning German film BELLA MARTHA (MOSTLY MARTHA) (Sandra Nettelbeck, 2001), is a satisfying soufflÃ© of comedy and romance, directed by Scott Hicks (SHINE, SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS) and featuring a piano-based soundtrack by minimalist musician Philip Glass. And just as she did in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, Breslin will both charm and break viewers' hearts. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

            <description>Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhart are charming in the romantic comedy NO RESERVATIONS. Zeta-Jones stars as Kate, an executive chef at a popular restaurant in New York City's Greenwich Village. She is so dedicated to her job that she has no time for a personal life; she even brings gourmet cuisine to her therapist (Bob Balaban), feeding him food rather than opening up her soul. But her life changes when her sister dies in a car accident, leaving Kate to take care of her sister's young daughter, Zoe (Abigail Breslin, from LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE). Suddenly, Kate is responsible for more than just fancy dishes; she is responsible for another human being, which confounds her. After taking a few days off, she returns to her kitchen, only to find that the restaurant owner, Paula (Patricia Clarkson), has hired another chef to assist Kate, a playful, talkative, talented man named Nick (Aaron Eckhart) who likes listening to opera while he works (Kate considers that a major distraction) and so wins over the rest of the staff that Kate feels threatened. But deep down, she also feels a little attracted by the attention Nick pours on her. However, Kate is not sure she can mix being a mother, a master chef, and, perhaps, a lover. NO RESERVATIONS, based on the award-winning German film BELLA MARTHA (MOSTLY MARTHA) (Sandra Nettelbeck, 2001), is a satisfying soufflÃ© of comedy and romance, directed by Scott Hicks (SHINE, SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS) and featuring a piano-based soundtrack by minimalist musician Philip Glass. And just as she did in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, Breslin will both charm and break viewers' hearts. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

            <description>Norbit (Eddie Murphy, channeling Buckwheat and Woody Allen) is a shy, nebbishy fellow, raised by Mr. Wong (Eddie Murphy again) in a combination orphanage/Chinese restaurant in Boiling Springs, Tennessee. As a child, Norbit comes to love Kate, a fellow orphan, but the soulmates are separated when Kate is adopted. Enter Rasputia, an aggressive, plus-sized 10-year-old who protects him from bullies and demands his romantic loyalty, much like her thuggish older brothers demand "protection" money from all the merchants in Boiling Springs. Rasputia and Norbit eventually marry--and the peevish adult Rasputia is played to great comic effect by Eddie Murphy in a fat suit. Although Rasputia is controlling, unfaithful, hideous-looking, and always madder than a hornet, she and Norbit make a life together, albeit one based on inertia, fear, and complacency.The bubble bursts when the now-grown Kate (Thandie Newton) returns to Boiling Springs to buy Mr. Wong's orphanage. Norbit's love is rekindled, and he must find a way to end his loveless marriage, save Kate from marrying a crooked philanderer (Cuba Gooding Jr., in a rare villainous turn), and prevent Rasputia's brothers from carrying through with a big con job that would destroy the orphanage and Kate's life. Eddie Murphy, not surprisingly, carries the show, with broad, juvenile humor, fat jokes, and pratfalls, and while he never aims very high, he manages to inject some poignancy into Norbit's and Wong's characters, even as he plays Rasputia strictly for laughs. It's not Shakespeare--it's not even BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE--but the laughs are as big as Rasputia's muumuu.  Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

            <description>Norbit (Eddie Murphy, channeling Buckwheat and Woody Allen) is a shy, nebbishy fellow, raised by Mr. Wong (Eddie Murphy again) in a combination orphanage/Chinese restaurant in Boiling Springs, Tennessee. As a child, Norbit comes to love Kate, a fellow orphan, but the soulmates are separated when Kate is adopted. Enter Rasputia, an aggressive, plus-sized 10-year-old who protects him from bullies and demands his romantic loyalty, much like her thuggish older brothers demand "protection" money from all the merchants in Boiling Springs. Rasputia and Norbit eventually marry--and the peevish adult Rasputia is played to great comic effect by Eddie Murphy in a fat suit. Although Rasputia is controlling, unfaithful, hideous-looking, and always madder than a hornet, she and Norbit make a life together, albeit one based on inertia, fear, and complacency.The bubble bursts when the now-grown Kate (Thandie Newton) returns to Boiling Springs to buy Mr. Wong's orphanage. Norbit's love is rekindled, and he must find a way to end his loveless marriage, save Kate from marrying a crooked philanderer (Cuba Gooding Jr., in a rare villainous turn), and prevent Rasputia's brothers from carrying through with a big con job that would destroy the orphanage and Kate's life. Eddie Murphy, not surprisingly, carries the show, with broad, juvenile humor, fat jokes, and pratfalls, and while he never aims very high, he manages to inject some poignancy into Norbit's and Wong's characters, even as he plays Rasputia strictly for laughs. It's not Shakespeare--it's not even BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE--but the laughs are as big as Rasputia's muumuu.  Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

The first half of the film transports viewers to 1939 Poland, and brings it to life clearly and believably. Szpilman is a tall, handsome, winsome man who is revered for his piano performances on public radio. He lives with his family--an intelligent, loving, and spirited bunch--in an upscale flat in central Warsaw. Bombings have begun to torment the citizens of Warsaw, and step by step, the Nazis infiltrate, the Jews are branded and set apart from their neighbors, imprisoned in a ghetto, and slowly exterminated. The story is told through Szpilman's eyes, and thus carries as much confusion and fear as disgust and torment. Polanski paints Warsaw in bleak shades of gray and black, expressing the helplessness of the Jewish people and the cruelty of the Nazis with captivating photography. In the second half of the film, which takes place in the early 1940s, Szpilman is alone, having managed to avoid the trains to the death camps. His struggle to survive, with some help from non-Jews but mostly his own will to thrive, takes place in long, silent, languid stretches filled with the imagined piano music that inspires Szpilman to live. In a climactic scene of immense beauty and spine-tingling tension, Szpilman must actually perform for a German soldier who is inexplicably patrolling the near-deserted and utterly dilapidated Warsaw ghetto. THE PIANIST, in the subtlety of its sublime and heartbreaking tale, is carried by the intensely moving performance of Brody, whose transformation is truly unforgettable.

            <description>Based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley, 300 takes over the screen like an invading horde. With all the gushing blood of a horror movie and the scope of a classic epic, the second film from Zack Snyder (who helmed the 2004 remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD) is an impressive visual spectacle. Gerard Butler (THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA) plays Leonidas, the king of ancient Sparta. The city is famous for its warrior philosophy, and Leonidas won't kneel to the demands of Persia's King Xerxes (LOST's Rodrigo Santoro). Instead, Leonidas leads his 300-strong army against Xerxes's army of millions. Meanwhile, his wife (Lena Headley, THE BROTHERS GRIMM) campaigns in Sparta for the city to send reinforcements as she butts heads with the treacherous Theron (Dominic West, THE WIRE).With its gore and scale, 300 marks director Snyder as a possible successor to Peter Jackson's throne. Jackson also got his start in horror with BAD TASTE and DEAD ALIVE, and the two men share a penchant for ambitious battle scenes. The huge fights in 300 rival Jackson's efforts in the LORD OF THE RINGS films. David Wenham, who starred in two of the Tolkien-based films, plays Dilios, one of the Spartan soldiers. Though the cast doesn't boast any A-list stars, the actors ably fill their larger-than-life roles. In a film filled with men, Headley stands out as Queen Gorgo. She matches her warrior husband in strength, while showing love toward Leonidas and their son. Though there are scenes that demonstrate the humanity of the characters, 300 is undeniably about bravery and blood, and it succeeds because of the stylish depictions of both.

Meanwhile, his wife (Lena Headley, THE BROTHERS GRIMM) campaigns in Sparta for the city to send reinforcements as she butts heads with the treacherous Theron (Dominic West, THE WIRE).With its gore and scale, 300 marks director Snyder as a possible successor to Peter Jackson's throne. Jackson also got his start in horror with BAD TASTE and DEAD ALIVE, and the two men share a penchant for ambitious battle scenes. The huge fights in 300 rival Jackson's efforts in the LORD OF THE RINGS films. David Wenham, who starred in two of the Tolkien-based films, plays Dilios, one of the Spartan soldiers. Though the cast doesn't boast any A-list stars, the actors ably fill their larger-than-life roles. In a film filled with men, Headley stands out as Queen Gorgo. She matches her warrior husband in strength, while showing love toward Leonidas and their son. Though there are scenes that demonstrate the humanity of the characters, 300 is undeniably about bravery and blood, and it succeeds because of the stylish depictions of both.

            <description>Based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley, 300 takes over the screen like an invading horde. With all the gushing blood of a horror movie and the scope of a classic epic, the second film from Zack Snyder (who helmed the 2004 remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD) is an impressive visual spectacle. Gerard Butler (THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA) plays Leonidas, the king of ancient Sparta. The city is famous for its warrior philosophy, and Leonidas won't kneel to the demands of Persia's King Xerxes (LOST's Rodrigo Santoro). Instead, Leonidas leads his 300-strong army against Xerxes's army of millions. Meanwhile, his wife (Lena Headley, THE BROTHERS GRIMM) campaigns in Sparta for the city to send reinforcements as she butts heads with the treacherous Theron (Dominic West, THE WIRE).With its gore and scale, 300 marks director Snyder as a possible successor to Peter Jackson's throne. Jackson also got his start in horror with BAD TASTE and DEAD ALIVE, and the two men share a penchant for ambitious battle scenes. The huge fights in 300 rival Jackson's efforts in the LORD OF THE RINGS films. David Wenham, who starred in two of the Tolkien-based films, plays Dilios, one of the Spartan soldiers. Though the cast doesn't boast any A-list stars, the actors ably fill their larger-than-life roles. In a film filled with men, Headley stands out as Queen Gorgo.

            <description>What happens when you want to go to college but no school accepts you? If you're Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long), you invent a fictitious university and create your own destiny. Playing like a PG-13 version of OLD SCHOOL, ACCEPTED follows the Ferris Bueller-esque Bartleby as he and his assembled crew of college rejects dupe the world by building the South Harmon Institute of Technology from scratch. There's his nerdy friend Sherman Schrader (Jonah Hill), who is actually enrolled in the well-established Harmon College across the way but who helps Bartleby with the logistics; the hyper-smart Rory (Maria Thayer), who put all her eggs into one basket and got rejected by her dream Ivy League school; Hands (Columbus Short), a football player who lost his scholarship when he blew out his knee; Glen (Adam Herschman), a former quickie-mart employee who is about as dumb as they come; and, finally, Uncle Ben (Lewis Black), a former academic who gets talked into become the makeshift school's dean when he gets fired from his latest job selling sneakers at the mall. What begins as an innocent ploy to make his parents happy quickly spirals out of control when Bartleby realizes that several hundred kids have shown up for orientation. As he digs himself into a deeper and more irrevocable hole, something strange happens: Bartleby realizes that he's actually on to something. Steve Pink's ACCEPTED is a lighthearted comedy that has its heart in the right place. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

            <description>Grammy-nominated rapper T.I., whose real name is Tip Harris, gives an inspired performance as the star of ATL. Set in Atlanta, Georgia, and directed by music video veteran Chris Robinson, ATL tells the story of a group of teenagers facing the harsh realities of life. T.I. plays Rashad, a young man making tremendous sacrifices so his little brother, Ant (Evan Ross, son of Diana Ross), can have a better future. Orphaned after their parents died in a car accident, Rashad and Ant work after school as janitors with their uncle George (Mykelti Williamson), who has taken them in to keep them out of foster homes. Every Sunday night, Rashad teams up at the roller-skating rink with his best friends: Esquire (Jackie Long), who has a shot at going to the Ivy League if he can make the right connection; Brooklyn (Albert "Al Be" Daniels), a soft-spoken poet carving out a career in the fast-food industry; and Teddy (Jason Weaver), who works at Eddy's Gold Teeth and provides much of the comic relief. At the rink, they get to be the stars of the show, whirling around, impressing girls, and just being themselves, far away from the daily grind. Rashad soon hooks up with New-New (Lauren London), who refuses to let him see where she lives, harboring a secret that could tear their growing love apart. Meanwhile, Ant starts doing jobs for local drug dealer Marcus (OutKast's Big Boi), attracted to the fancy cars and fast money, and Esquire has some tough choices to make after meeting a high-powered businessman (Keith David). With the critical roller-skating contest right around the corner, things reach a fever pitch, all set to a cranking crunk soundtrack. ATL was inspired by the real-life experiences of music producer Dallas Austin and TLC's Tionne "T-Boz" Watkins; the story is by Antwone Fisher, the subject of Denzel Washington's 2002 directorial debut.

            <description>Grammy-nominated rapper T.I., whose real name is Tip Harris, gives an inspired performance as the star of ATL. Set in Atlanta, Georgia, and directed by music video veteran Chris Robinson, ATL tells the story of a group of teenagers facing the harsh realities of life. T.I. plays Rashad, a young man making tremendous sacrifices so his little brother, Ant (Evan Ross, son of Diana Ross), can have a better future. Orphaned after their parents died in a car accident, Rashad and Ant work after school as janitors with their uncle George (Mykelti Williamson), who has taken them in to keep them out of foster homes. Every Sunday night, Rashad teams up at the roller-skating rink with his best friends: Esquire (Jackie Long), who has a shot at going to the Ivy League if he can make the right connection; Brooklyn (Albert "Al Be" Daniels), a soft-spoken poet carving out a career in the fast-food industry; and Teddy (Jason Weaver), who works at Eddy's Gold Teeth and provides much of the comic relief. At the rink, they get to be the stars of the show, whirling around, impressing girls, and just being themselves, far away from the daily grind. Rashad soon hooks up with New-New (Lauren London), who refuses to let him see where she lives, harboring a secret that could tear their growing love apart. Meanwhile, Ant starts doing jobs for local drug dealer Marcus (OutKast's Big Boi), attracted to the fancy cars and fast money, and Esquire has some tough choices to make after meeting a high-powered businessman (Keith David). With the critical roller-skating contest right around the corner, things reach a fever pitch, all set to a cranking crunk soundtrack. ATL was inspired by the real-life experiences of music producer Dallas Austin and TLC's Tionne "T-Boz" Watkins; the story is by Antwone Fisher, the subject of Denzel Washington's 2002 directorial debut.

            <description>Three hilarious films starring Mike Myers as the groovy special agent, Austin Powers; INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY, THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME, and GOLDMEMBER. See individual titles for further information.AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY: The dastardly doings of Dr. Evil lead to his escape into outer space and the cryogenic freezing of super-agent Austin Powers. Thirty years later Dr. Evil returns to earth to bring about terror and mass destruction but finds his ideas and methods a bit out of date. So too does our hero who upon being thawed out, finds he's a bit behind the times as well. Well meaning and bumbling efforts to thwart the insidious Dr. Evil keep Austin and his devastatingly beautiful partner Vanessa busy from London to Las Vegas. Freedom in the '90s, baby! A hilarious send up of James Bond spy films and 1960s schtick.AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME: In his second screen adventure, British super-spy Austin Powers must return to 1969, as arch-nemisis Dr. Evil has ventured back to that year and successfully stolen Austin's "mojo" (libido!) and set up an ultra-powerful cannon and aimed it at the Earth. With the help of gorgeous agent Felicity Shagwell, the newly single Austin must now not only contend with Dr. Evil, but also Evil's vicious, pint-size attack-clone, Mini-Me. Also in this installment, Evil's son, Scott, finds out who his mother is and Mike Myers stars as a third character, rotund Scotsman Fat Bastard. More raucous fun in the spirit of its 1997 smash predecessor.AUSTIN POWERS IN GOLDMEMBER: The third movie in the Austin Powers series, stars Mike Myers in director Jay Roach's James Bond Sci-Fi 1970s funkadelic formula--a hyper-stylized backdrop to what is ultimately Myers' one-man show.GOLDMEMBER is a family affair. Austin has a few unresolved issues with his dear old dad, Nigel Powers (the dead ringer Michael Caine, who is also a good sport), and he hopes to work out some Freudian tension when he's not saving the world from the forces of evil. Myers flexes his actor muscles and portrays a more thoughtful, and--is it even possible--a slightly less geeky Austin in this film. Likewise, even the bad guys show some new personality: Dr. Evil reveals a penchant for talking like a hip-hop, wise-ass homeboy, and the new villain Goldmember (the latest in Myers' repertoire) is an enigmatic amputee with a heart of gold who speaks with a Dutch accent and eats his own peeling skin. If that's not disgusting enough, Fat Bastard, the greasy behemoth from the THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME, appears again in GOLDMEMBER, delving into new and nasty scatological territory. But the joke's on us, because GOLDMEMBER's toilet humor is so extreme that it dissolves into a harmless fit of giggles, keeping viewers laughing from start to finish. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.

See individual titles for further information.AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY: The dastardly doings of Dr. Evil lead to his escape into outer space and the cryogenic freezing of super-agent Austin Powers. Thirty years later Dr. Evil returns to earth to bring about terror and mass destruction but finds his ideas and methods a bit out of date. So too does our hero who upon being thawed out, finds he's a bit behind the times as well. Well meaning and bumbling efforts to thwart the insidious Dr. Evil keep Austin and his devastatingly beautiful partner Vanessa busy from London to Las Vegas. Freedom in the '90s, baby! A hilarious send up of James Bond spy films and 1960s schtick.AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME: In his second screen adventure, British super-spy Austin Powers must return to 1969, as arch-nemisis Dr. Evil has ventured back to that year and successfully stolen Austin's "mojo" (libido!) and set up an ultra-powerful cannon and aimed it at the Earth. With the help of gorgeous agent Felicity Shagwell, the newly single Austin must now not only contend with Dr. Evil, but also Evil's vicious, pint-size attack-clone, Mini-Me. Also in this installment, Evil's son, Scott, finds out who his mother is and Mike Myers stars as a third character, rotund Scotsman Fat Bastard. More raucous fun in the spirit of its 1997 smash predecessor.AUSTIN POWERS IN GOLDMEMBER: The third movie in the Austin Powers series, stars Mike Myers in director Jay Roach's James Bond Sci-Fi 1970s funkadelic formula--a hyper-stylized backdrop to what is ultimately Myers' one-man show.GOLDMEMBER is a family affair. Austin has a few unresolved issues with his dear old dad, Nigel Powers (the dead ringer Michael Caine, who is also a good sport), and he hopes to work out some Freudian tension when he's not saving the world from the forces of evil. Myers flexes his actor muscles and portrays a more thoughtful, and--is it even possible--a slightly less geeky Austin in this film. Likewise, even the bad guys show some new personality: Dr. Evil reveals a penchant for talking like a hip-hop, wise-ass homeboy, and the new villain Goldmember (the latest in Myers' repertoire) is an enigmatic amputee with a heart of gold who speaks with a Dutch accent and eats his own peeling skin. If that's not disgusting enough, Fat Bastard, the greasy behemoth from the THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME, appears again in GOLDMEMBER, delving into new and nasty scatological territory. But the joke's on us, because GOLDMEMBER's toilet humor is so extreme that it dissolves into a harmless fit of giggles, keeping viewers laughing from start to finish. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.

            <description>Martin Scorsese's THE AVIATOR is a lavish spectacle of a motion picture that harks back to Hollywood's Golden Era in telling the story of Howard Hughes, one of 20th-century America's most pioneering and influential figures. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio as the eccentric billionaire, Scorsese's biopic concentrates on Hughes's life between the 1920s and '40s, when he made striking contributions to both the film and aviation industries. At only 25 years of age, Hughes directed the most expensive film ever made up to that point, HELL'S ANGELS (1930), which Scorsese gleefully recreates here in all its sprawling, audacious glory. At the same time, he became known as an unabashed playboy, bedding the likes of Jean Harlow (singer Gwen Stefani), Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale), and Katherine Hepburn (a brilliant Cate Blanchett). In the mid-'30s, he turned his attention to the aviation industry, where he quickly became world-renowned for shattering speed and distance records. He also continued to test the limits of flight technology, building bigger, faster, and stronger aircrafts. All the while, he struggled with an obsessive-compulsive disorder that sent him into a full-fledged tailspin after a near-fatal plane crash. The film concludes with Hughes being called before the Senate in 1947 to defend himself against the nefarious Senator Owen Brewster (Alan Alda), who accused Hughes of taking money from the United States government during wartime.Stunningly photographed by Robert Richardson, Scorsese's nearly three-hour drama features an impassioned performance by DiCaprio, who is also credited as an executive producer.

            <description>Martin Scorsese's THE AVIATOR is a lavish spectacle of a motion picture that harks back to Hollywood's Golden Era in telling the story of Howard Hughes, one of 20th-century America's most pioneering and influential figures. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio as the eccentric billionaire, Scorsese's biopic concentrates on Hughes's life between the 1920s and '40s, when he made striking contributions to both the film and aviation industries. At only 25 years of age, Hughes directed the most expensive film ever made up to that point, HELL'S ANGELS (1930), which Scorsese gleefully recreates here in all its sprawling, audacious glory. At the same time, he became known as an unabashed playboy, bedding the likes of Jean Harlow (singer Gwen Stefani), Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale), and Katherine Hepburn (a brilliant Cate Blanchett). In the mid-'30s, he turned his attention to the aviation industry, where he quickly became world-renowned for shattering speed and distance records. He also continued to test the limits of flight technology, building bigger, faster, and stronger aircrafts. All the while, he struggled with an obsessive-compulsive disorder that sent him into a full-fledged tailspin after a near-fatal plane crash. The film concludes with Hughes being called before the Senate in 1947 to defend himself against the nefarious Senator Owen Brewster (Alan Alda), who accused Hughes of taking money from the United States government during wartime.Stunningly photographed by Robert Richardson, Scorsese's nearly three-hour drama features an impassioned performance by DiCaprio, who is also credited as an executive producer. Although she appears in less than a third of the film, Blanchett delivers a performance that cements her status as one of the finest actresses ever to appear on the big screen.

            <description>With a title that insures against accusations of false advertising, BEERFEST is a raunchy and genial amalgamation of ANIMAL HOUSE, STRANGE BREW, FIGHT CLUB, and every clichÃ©d sports film ever made. Written by and starring comedy troupe Broken Lizard (SUPER TROOPERS, CLUB DREAD) and directed by Lizard member Jay Chandrasekhar, the film is unapologetically sophomoric, never missing a chance for a belch, flatulence, bared breasts, or Cloris Leachman doing lewd things with a sausage. After the death of their bar-owning German grandfather (Donald Sutherland), Jan (Paul Soter) and Todd (Erik Stolhanske) Wolfhouse must travel to Munich to scatter his ashes. Fortunately for them, it's Oktoberfest, but the brothers aren't there very long before they embarrass themselves at a public celebration and find themselves at Beerfest, an annual international underground beer-guzzling competition. When they compete, they are disgraced by their German cousins, the Von Wolfhausens--headed by father Jurgen Prochnow--who claim that the Wolfhouses' late grandfather stole a beer recipe from them many years before. Jan and Todd return home to train for next year's competition, incorporating into their team a few old college pals--male prostitute Barry (Chandrasekhar), burly Landfill (Kevin Heffernan), and science nerd Fink (Steve Lemme). For BEERFEST to work, it's imperative that viewers find humor in exaggerated German accents. Cloris Leachman appears to be enjoying throwing all comic caution to the wind, and Prochnow gets to lampoon DAS BOOT in a funny sequence. Big, sloppy, and ridiculous--compliments in this case--all apply to the third Broken Lizard feature, which is sure to burp its way into every fraternity house film library until the world ends.

            <description>With a title that insures against accusations of false advertising, BEERFEST is a raunchy and genial amalgamation of ANIMAL HOUSE, STRANGE BREW, FIGHT CLUB, and every clichÃ©d sports film ever made. Written by and starring comedy troupe Broken Lizard (SUPER TROOPERS, CLUB DREAD) and directed by Lizard member Jay Chandrasekhar, the film is unapologetically sophomoric, never missing a chance for a belch, flatulence, bared breasts, or Cloris Leachman doing lewd things with a sausage. After the death of their bar-owning German grandfather (Donald Sutherland), Jan (Paul Soter) and Todd (Erik Stolhanske) Wolfhouse must travel to Munich to scatter his ashes. Fortunately for them, it's Oktoberfest, but the brothers aren't there very long before they embarrass themselves at a public celebration and find themselves at Beerfest, an annual international underground beer-guzzling competition. When they compete, they are disgraced by their German cousins, the Von Wolfhausens--headed by father Jurgen Prochnow--who claim that the Wolfhouses' late grandfather stole a beer recipe from them many years before. Jan and Todd return home to train for next year's competition, incorporating into their team a few old college pals--male prostitute Barry (Chandrasekhar), burly Landfill (Kevin Heffernan), and science nerd Fink (Steve Lemme). For BEERFEST to work, it's imperative that viewers find humor in exaggerated German accents. Cloris Leachman appears to be enjoying throwing all comic caution to the wind, and Prochnow gets to lampoon DAS BOOT in a funny sequence. Big, sloppy, and ridiculous--compliments in this case--all apply to the third Broken Lizard feature, which is sure to burp its way into every fraternity house film library until the world ends.

            <description>Directed by Alejandro Agresti (VALENTIN), THE LAKE HOUSE reunites Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves for the first time since 1994's smash hit SPEED in this love story that transcends the limitations of time. When Doctor Kate Forster (Bullock) moves from a unique glass lake house to Chicago, she leaves a note in the mailbox for the new tenant asking that they forward any stray mail and apologizing for some mild inconveniences at the house that were there when she arrived, including paw prints in the entryway. Architect Alex Wyler (Reeves) moves in and finds Kate's note in the mailbox, but is confused--he responds that there are no paw prints to be found, and as far as he knows, the house has been empty for quite some time. When a stray dog runs past him as he is working on the entryway and leaves the trail of paw prints that Kate mentioned, Alex realizes that they are living in different years.Nonplussed by this odd turn of events, Alex and Kate continue to correspond via notes and letters left in the lake house mailbox. Soon they are sharing their secrets, confiding in each other, and falling in love. The film follows each character in his/her current time, chronicling Alex's relationship with his brother (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) and estranged father (Christopher Plummer), as well as Kate's relationship with on-again/off-again boyfriend, Morgan (Dylan Walsh). As in all great love stories, Kate and Alex will ultimately have to take a chance. Can he wait for her until they are together in time?  Will they each make the choices that ultimately allow them to be together?  Only time will tell. Based on the South Korean film IL MARE, this visually appealing film makes wonderful use of Chicago and its architecture. Bullock and Reeves are both solid and likeable in the lead roles, bringing to life the wistfulness that Kate and Alex feel. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.

Based on the South Korean film IL MARE, this visually appealing film makes wonderful use of Chicago and its architecture. Bullock and Reeves are both solid and likeable in the lead roles, bringing to life the wistfulness that Kate and Alex feel. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.

            <description>Directed by Alejandro Agresti (VALENTIN), THE LAKE HOUSE reunites Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves for the first time since 1994's smash hit SPEED in this love story that transcends the limitations of time. When Doctor Kate Forster (Bullock) moves from a unique glass lake house to Chicago, she leaves a note in the mailbox for the new tenant asking that they forward any stray mail and apologizing for some mild inconveniences at the house that were there when she arrived, including paw prints in the entryway. Architect Alex Wyler (Reeves) moves in and finds Kate's note in the mailbox, but is confused--he responds that there are no paw prints to be found, and as far as he knows, the house has been empty for quite some time. When a stray dog runs past him as he is working on the entryway and leaves the trail of paw prints that Kate mentioned, Alex realizes that they are living in different years.Nonplussed by this odd turn of events, Alex and Kate continue to correspond via notes and letters left in the lake house mailbox. Soon they are sharing their secrets, confiding in each other, and falling in love. The film follows each character in his/her current time, chronicling Alex's relationship with his brother (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) and estranged father (Christopher Plummer), as well as Kate's relationship with on-again/off-again boyfriend, Morgan (Dylan Walsh). As in all great love stories, Kate and Alex will ultimately have to take a chance. Can he wait for her until they are together in time?  Will they each make the choices that ultimately allow them to be together?  Only time will tell. Based on the South Korean film IL MARE, this visually appealing film makes wonderful use of Chicago and its architecture.

            <description>Very few Led Zeppelin performances were caught on camera during the band's life-span, but the footage that has been preserved for posterity is collected on this release. With a running time of over five-and-a-half hours, this is the definitive word on Zep's global stage-straddling performances. The footage is taken from London's Royal Albert Hall in January 1970, London's Earls Court in May 1975, Knebworth in August 1979, and Madison Square Garden in July 1973. Guitarist Jimmy Page has taken great care to restore, remix, and remaster the sound from these shows, providing a visual and sonic assault that offers indisputable proof of Led Zeppelin's reputation as a rock &amp; roll behemoth. Additional footage comes in the shape of several television interviews, a bootleg shot of the band performing "Heartbreaker," behind the scenes footage from Knebworth, and a whole lot more.

            <description>Though Oscar winner Morgan Freeman is best known for playing noble characters in films such as MILLION DOLLAR BABY and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, he goes over to the dark side for this thriller. John Cusack (1408) plays Ray Keene, a father who organizes a hiking trip so he can get closer to his son after his wife's passing. But their vacation is interrupted by the arrival of a brutal hit man (Freeman), who will do anything to collect his fee as a contract killer. THE CONTRACT reunites Freeman with his DRIVING MISS DAISY director Bruce Beresford, who also directed the tense film DOUBLE JEOPARDY. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.

            <description>Though Oscar winner Morgan Freeman is best known for playing noble characters in films such as MILLION DOLLAR BABY and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, he goes over to the dark side for this thriller. John Cusack (1408) plays Ray Keene, a father who organizes a hiking trip so he can get closer to his son after his wife's passing. But their vacation is interrupted by the arrival of a brutal hit man (Freeman), who will do anything to collect his fee as a contract killer. THE CONTRACT reunites Freeman with his DRIVING MISS DAISY director Bruce Beresford, who also directed the tense film DOUBLE JEOPARDY. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.

            <description>After his cowhands desert him for a nearby gold rush, aging, leather-tough rancher Will Anderson (John Wayne) resorts to hiring 11 schoolboys to help him on a 400-mile cattle run. Setting off with the boys and an eloquent but equally tough black cook (Roscoe Lee Browne), Anderson must get his cattle to their destination while contending with the wilderness and a psychotic, vengeful ex-con (Bruce Dern) who is out to get him. With an amazingly natural performance by Wayne, this stylized, action-packed Western is exquisitely filmed, emotionally sensitive, and highly entertaining. Director Mark Rydell gets solid performances out of not just Wayne (in one of his later screen roles) and Browne, but the group of youngsters accompanying them on the journey, as well as actors like Slim Pickens and Colleen Dewhurst who play smaller supporting roles. Close attention is also paid to the natural beauty of the mountains, wild mustangs, and other often overlooked standard Western fare. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.

            <description>The Farrelly Brothers add their trademark bounty of bodily functions to this remake of Elaine May's 1972 comedy, THE HEARTBREAK KID. This time around Ben Stiller plays Eddie Cantrow, a 40-year-old bachelor who is tired of having his foulmouthed father (Jerry Stiller) and henpecked friend (Rob Corddry) give him a hard time for not being married. So when he meets the seemingly perfect Lila (Malin Ackerman), he decides to marry her--despite knowing her for only six weeks. On their honeymoon in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, he realizes his mistake when Lila reveals her true colors, which turn out to be quite ugly. While Lila recovers from a sunburn, Eddie meets fellow vacationer Miranda (Michelle Monaghan) and falls in love. He must break the news to both women before they find out the truth.After the more standard romantic comedy of FEVER PITCH, Bobby and Peter Farrelly are back to the gross-out comedy that made them famous in films such as THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY. This is the first time they've re-teamed with Stiller since that landmark film, and it proves a far better marriage than Eddie and Lila's. Ackerman may be most famous to date for a small role in HAROLD &amp; KUMAR GO TO WHITE CASTLE, but she's fearless in this part. The Farrellys have always been fans of bodily humor, and Ackerman's Lila gets to be the butt of the joke most often, largely thanks to her character's deviated septum. There are several moments here that threaten to top the infamous hair-gel scene in THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY as far as groans and giggles go. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.

            <description>The Farrelly Brothers add their trademark bounty of bodily functions to this remake of Elaine May's 1972 comedy, THE HEARTBREAK KID. This time around Ben Stiller plays Eddie Cantrow, a 40-year-old bachelor who is tired of having his foulmouthed father (Jerry Stiller) and henpecked friend (Rob Corddry) give him a hard time for not being married. So when he meets the seemingly perfect Lila (Malin Ackerman), he decides to marry her--despite knowing her for only six weeks. On their honeymoon in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, he realizes his mistake when Lila reveals her true colors, which turn out to be quite ugly. While Lila recovers from a sunburn, Eddie meets fellow vacationer Miranda (Michelle Monaghan) and falls in love. He must break the news to both women before they find out the truth.After the more standard romantic comedy of FEVER PITCH, Bobby and Peter Farrelly are back to the gross-out comedy that made them famous in films such as THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY. This is the first time they've re-teamed with Stiller since that landmark film, and it proves a far better marriage than Eddie and Lila's. Ackerman may be most famous to date for a small role in HAROLD &amp; KUMAR GO TO WHITE CASTLE, but she's fearless in this part. The Farrellys have always been fans of bodily humor, and Ackerman's Lila gets to be the butt of the joke most often, largely thanks to her character's deviated septum. There are several moments here that threaten to top the infamous hair-gel scene in THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY as far as groans and giggles go. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.

            <description>Playing Superman on TV brought aspiring film actor George Reeves stardom, but it also held him back as far as more serious acting roles went. When a 45-year-old Reeves was found dead in his home in 1959, his death was ruled a suicide, and attributed to this B-level frustration. The result of a single bullet wound, Reeves's death caused controversy in and around Hollywood, where popular theories related his death to either his starlet fiancÃ©, Leonore Lemmon (Robin Tunney), or his famously ongoing and unique relationship with Toni Mannix (a fabulous Diane Lane), the wife of mob-connected MGM head Eddie Mannix (Bob Hoskins).HOLLYWOODLAND explores Reeves's life and tragic end from the perspective of Louis Simo (Adrien Brody), a private investigator hired by Reeves's mother shortly after his death. Cutting back and forth between scenes of Reeves's life and Simo's detective work, the film draws parallels between two men kept from appreciating the present by dreams of future grandeur. Ben Affleck returns to form as Reeves, a man whose hindering celebrity status may have reminded the actor of his own: despite breaking onto the scene with an Academy Award for writing GOOD WILL HUNTING in 1997, Affleck's career was at one point overshadowed by a romance as familiar to the public as Superman's cape. With close attention to detail, first-time director Allen Coulter creates two distinct worlds specific to their time, Simo's noir-ish and seedy L.A. forming a bleak contrast to the glamorous, formal Tinseltown Reeves so longed to be embraced by. An accomplished act for a first time director, HOLLYWOODLAND offers viewers a believable look into Hollywood's most glamorous bygone era. Strong performances and stylish filmmaking help fuel a mystery without a solution. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

            <description>Bong Joon-ho's THE HOST is a giddy revelation--an inspired and unexpectedly moving contribution to the monster movie genre. Several years ago, a crooked government official from the United States ordered the dumping of toxic substances into Seoul's Han River. Years later, the hapless Gang-du (Song Kang-ho) is working at his father's food stand along the river, caring for his bright daughter Hyun-seo (Ko A-sung). But one day, a monstrous creature emerges from the water and embarks on a murderous rampage throughout the community, swallowing Hyun-seo whole. Gang-du's bullish younger brother Park Nam-il (Park Hae-il) and sister Nam-joo (Bae Doo-na) condemn him for being such a failure, while their father angrily chastises them for being so cruel. But when Gang-du receives a cell phone call from Hyun-seo, the family must band together to reclaim her. Unfortunately, at this stage, the government has announced that the monster is the host of a dangerous virus, and anyone who has come into contact with it--namely Gang-du--must be isolated. As the monster continues to wreak havoc on Seoul, Gang-du, his father, and his siblings must learn to work together to bring Hyun-seo home. Bong Joon-ho's third film, after BARKING DOGS NEVER BITE and MEMORIES OF MURDER, firmly establishes his status as one of the world's most gifted storytellers. Not simply a monster movie spectacle--though it is certainly that and then some--THE HOST also works as a poignant family drama and a biting critique of America's invasion of Iraq.

            <description>Director John Boorman's harrowing adaptation of James Dickey's best-selling novel is a nightmarish descent into backwoods Americana. When four unsuspecting urbanites head into the mountains of northern Georgia for a weekend canoe trip, they have no idea what's in store for them. The group's macho leader, Lewis Medlock (Burt Reynolds), is driven by Hemingway-esque notions of man's ability to conquer nature, while his three friends--Bobby Trippe (Ned Beatty), Drew Ballinger (Ronny Cox), and Ed Gentry (Jon Voight)--aren't so sure. As the men begin to navigate their way down the precarious rapids, they discover that nature isn't the only one out to get them. The eventual appearance of two menacing hillbillies turns the vacation into an all-out nightmare.Photographed by the great Vilmos Zsigmond (MCCABE &amp; MRS. MILLER, THE DEER HUNTER), DELIVERANCE is a compelling meditation on the dangers of masculine ritual. Reynolds dives headlong into the role that would make him a superstar, as does Beatty, whose legendary big-screen debut will never be forgotten. Boorman's thriller made two other lasting contributions to the pop-culture lexicon: the dueling-banjos sequence and the infamous line, "Squeal like a pig!" Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.

            <description>Director John Boorman's harrowing adaptation of James Dickey's best-selling novel is a nightmarish descent into backwoods Americana. When four unsuspecting urbanites head into the mountains of northern Georgia for a weekend canoe trip, they have no idea what's in store for them. The group's macho leader, Lewis Medlock (Burt Reynolds), is driven by Hemingway-esque notions of man's ability to conquer nature, while his three friends--Bobby Trippe (Ned Beatty), Drew Ballinger (Ronny Cox), and Ed Gentry (Jon Voight)--aren't so sure. As the men begin to navigate their way down the precarious rapids, they discover that nature isn't the only one out to get them.

            <description>Director Martin Scorsese returns to his trademark style with the violent, bruised, and bloody feature THE DEPARTED. Scorsese filched the basic storyline from Wai Keung Lau and Siu Fai Mak's masterful 2002 Hong Kong action film, INFERNAL AFFAIRS, which saw a policeman going undercover as a mob member and a mob member infiltrating the police force. Scorsese transfers the action to Boston, positioning Leonardo Di Caprio as undercover cop William Costigan and Matt Damon as undercover mobster Colin Sullivan. While Costigan and Sullivan get into plenty of nail-biting situations that almost reveal their true identities, Scorsese gradually unravels his strong supporting cast, including Jack Nicholson as Sullivan's mob boss, Frank Costello; Ray Winstone as Costello's meat-headed muscle; Mark Wahlberg as a hot-headed police sergeant; and Vera Farmiga as a love interest for both Damon and DiCaprio's characters.THE DEPARTED finds Scorsese generously dipping his toes back into waters that will be warmly familiar to his biggest fans. Rolling Stones songs pepper the soundtrack, recalling the remarkable "Jumpin' Jack Flash" sequence in MEAN STREETS; bullets and blood punctuate every key scene, bringing TAXI DRIVER's explosive finale to mind; and the mobster-themed storyline is a thrilling return to GOODFELLAS territory. Nicholson and Winstone provide acting master-classes every time they appear, neatly complementing the blossoming talents of DiCaprio, Damon, and Wahlberg, while further veteran support comes in small roles for Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin. Scorsese is often criticized for affording precious little screen time to female characters, and THE DEPARTED won't quell those dissenting voices, although Farmiga's character proves to be more than a match for DiCaprio and Damon's posturings. But Scorsese followers who balked at his diversions into documentary filmmaking (NO DIRECTION HOME) and period epics (THE AVIATOR) will be delighted to find raw male machismo puncturing the screen once again in this frenetic entry into his celebrated oeuvre.

            <description>Director Martin Scorsese returns to his trademark style with the violent, bruised, and bloody feature THE DEPARTED. Scorsese filched the basic storyline from Wai Keung Lau and Siu Fai Mak's masterful 2002 Hong Kong action film, INFERNAL AFFAIRS, which saw a policeman going undercover as a mob member and a mob member infiltrating the police force. Scorsese transfers the action to Boston, positioning Leonardo Di Caprio as undercover cop William Costigan and Matt Damon as undercover mobster Colin Sullivan. While Costigan and Sullivan get into plenty of nail-biting situations that almost reveal their true identities, Scorsese gradually unravels his strong supporting cast, including Jack Nicholson as Sullivan's mob boss, Frank Costello; Ray Winstone as Costello's meat-headed muscle; Mark Wahlberg as a hot-headed police sergeant; and Vera Farmiga as a love interest for both Damon and DiCaprio's characters.THE DEPARTED finds Scorsese generously dipping his toes back into waters that will be warmly familiar to his biggest fans. Rolling Stones songs pepper the soundtrack, recalling the remarkable "Jumpin' Jack Flash" sequence in MEAN STREETS; bullets and blood punctuate every key scene, bringing TAXI DRIVER's explosive finale to mind; and the mobster-themed storyline is a thrilling return to GOODFELLAS territory. Nicholson and Winstone provide acting master-classes every time they appear, neatly complementing the blossoming talents of DiCaprio, Damon, and Wahlberg, while further veteran support comes in small roles for Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin. Scorsese is often criticized for affording precious little screen time to female characters, and THE DEPARTED won't quell those dissenting voices, although Farmiga's character proves to be more than a match for DiCaprio and Damon's posturings. But Scorsese followers who balked at his diversions into documentary filmmaking (NO DIRECTION HOME) and period epics (THE AVIATOR) will be delighted to find raw male machismo puncturing the screen once again in this frenetic entry into his celebrated oeuvre.

            <description>THE HULK, adapted by Ang Lee (CROUCHING TIGER/HIDDEN DRAGON, THE ICE STORM) from the Marvel comic book series, stars Eric Bana as Bruce Banner, the tormented scientist whose temper periodically transforms him into a raging green monster. Fellow scientist and Hulk-love-interest Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly), shares a strange connection with Banner--both have abstract childhood nightmares that hint at a shared dark past. The missing pieces of the puzzle are revealed when Banner's unstable, mad-scientist father David (Nick Nolte) appears out of the blue, followed by Betty's father Ross (Sam Elliot), a military cowboy. Banner is ultimately trying to understand what it is that makes his strange and unpredictable metamorphosis occur, while his outbursts distract him, leading him out into the streets of San Francisco, to the Golden Gate Bridge, and on a tour of the American west's national parks where he unleashes his anger in violent tantrums. Posing a threat to the country that is treated like a natural disaster, the hulk attracts the attention of the military. They respond by chasing the hulk with helicopters, machine guys, and even heavy artillery, as he bounds away in mighty leaps, trying to escape. The CGI work used in creating the hulk is funny and convincing, and the gorgeous landscape photography makes his presence all the more amazing. A vibrant color scheme adds to the film's visual thrills, split-screen editing breaks up the slower scenes, and the music by composer Danny Elfman perfectly punctuates the contrast between the soft love story and wild action sequences. While parts of the film recall the introspection of FRANKENSTEIN, the outrageous crowd-pleasing monster-military chases hearken back to KING KONG and the GODZILLA movies.

            <description>THE HULK, adapted by Ang Lee (CROUCHING TIGER/HIDDEN DRAGON, THE ICE STORM) from the Marvel comic book series, stars Eric Bana as Bruce Banner, the tormented scientist whose temper periodically transforms him into a raging green monster. Fellow scientist and Hulk-love-interest Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly), shares a strange connection with Banner--both have abstract childhood nightmares that hint at a shared dark past. The missing pieces of the puzzle are revealed when Banner's unstable, mad-scientist father David (Nick Nolte) appears out of the blue, followed by Betty's father Ross (Sam Elliot), a military cowboy. Banner is ultimately trying to understand what it is that makes his strange and unpredictable metamorphosis occur, while his outbursts distract him, leading him out into the streets of San Francisco, to the Golden Gate Bridge, and on a tour of the American west's national parks where he unleashes his anger in violent tantrums. Posing a threat to the country that is treated like a natural disaster, the hulk attracts the attention of the military. They respond by chasing the hulk with helicopters, machine guys, and even heavy artillery, as he bounds away in mighty leaps, trying to escape. The CGI work used in creating the hulk is funny and convincing, and the gorgeous landscape photography makes his presence all the more amazing. A vibrant color scheme adds to the film's visual thrills, split-screen editing breaks up the slower scenes, and the music by composer Danny Elfman perfectly punctuates the contrast between the soft love story and wild action sequences. While parts of the film recall the introspection of FRANKENSTEIN, the outrageous crowd-pleasing monster-military chases hearken back to KING KONG and the GODZILLA movies.

            <description>The inspirational true story of boxer Rubin "The Hurricane" Carter, who was wrongfully convicted of murder in 1966. Told in a series of flashbacks, Washington immerses himself in the role of Carter with a charged, intense passion. The story jumps around in time, from Carter's troubled childhood, to his arrest in 1966, to his fruitless appeals, settling in 1983, when a group of three white adults and a black teenager dedicate their lives to freeing him. Jewison's assured direction keeps these stories from getting jumbled and blurring together. Even in flashbacks, the plot moves forward dramatically, to its eventual rousing conclusion. Based on the novels THE 16TH ROUND by Carter and LAZARUS AND THE HURRICANE by Chaiton and Swinton. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

            <description>A star-studded cast provides the voices for the prehistoric creatures in this computer-animated feature set 20,000 years ago as the Ice Age approaches. Seemingly anti-social Manny, a woolly mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), acts as if he just wants to be left alone. When he meets Sid (voiced by John Leguizamo), a sloth, the two become unlikely traveling companions. The plot thickens when the duo finds a human infant and decides to try to return the child to its "herd." Manny slowly but surely reveals his heart of gold, while Sid continues to provide comic relief. Diego (voiced by Denis Leary), a saber-tooth tiger with ulterior motives, soon joins them in their search for the humans. Ultimately, this group of misfits becomes its own herd, learning about friendship and loyalty as they brave snow, ice, freezing temperatures, predators, hail, and even boiling lava pits. All the while, a saber-tooth squirrel, Scat, provides comic relief as he valiantly struggles with an acorn. A well-written, humorous script and endearing characters mesh well with the state-of-the-art technology and effects. Other stars lending their voices to the feature include Goran Visnjic, Jack Black, and Jane Krakowski. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

            <description>A star-studded cast provides the voices for the prehistoric creatures in this computer-animated feature set 20,000 years ago as the Ice Age approaches. Seemingly anti-social Manny, a woolly mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), acts as if he just wants to be left alone. When he meets Sid (voiced by John Leguizamo), a sloth, the two become unlikely traveling companions. The plot thickens when the duo finds a human infant and decides to try to return the child to its "herd." Manny slowly but surely reveals his heart of gold, while Sid continues to provide comic relief. Diego (voiced by Denis Leary), a saber-tooth tiger with ulterior motives, soon joins them in their search for the humans. Ultimately, this group of misfits becomes its own herd, learning about friendship and loyalty as they brave snow, ice, freezing temperatures, predators, hail, and even boiling lava pits. All the while, a saber-tooth squirrel, Scat, provides comic relief as he valiantly struggles with an acorn. A well-written, humorous script and endearing characters mesh well with the state-of-the-art technology and effects. Other stars lending their voices to the feature include Goran Visnjic, Jack Black, and Jane Krakowski. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

            <description>A star-studded cast provides the voices for the prehistoric creatures in this computer-animated feature set 20,000 years ago as the Ice Age approaches. Seemingly anti-social Manny, a woolly mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), acts as if he just wants to be left alone. When he meets Sid (voiced by John Leguizamo), a sloth, the two become unlikely traveling companions. The plot thickens when the duo finds a human infant and decides to try to return the child to its "herd." Manny slowly but surely reveals his heart of gold, while Sid continues to provide comic relief. Diego (voiced by Denis Leary), a saber-tooth tiger with ulterior motives, soon joins them in their search for the humans. Ultimately, this group of misfits becomes its own herd, learning about friendship and loyalty as they brave snow, ice, freezing temperatures, predators, hail, and even boiling lava pits. All the while, a saber-tooth squirrel, Scat, provides comic relief as he valiantly struggles with an acorn. A well-written, humorous script and endearing characters mesh well with the state-of-the-art technology and effects. Other stars lending their voices to the feature include Goran Visnjic, Jack Black, and Jane Krakowski. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

            <description>A star-studded cast provides the voices for the prehistoric creatures in this computer-animated feature set 20,000 years ago as the Ice Age approaches. Seemingly anti-social Manny, a woolly mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), acts as if he just wants to be left alone. When he meets Sid (voiced by John Leguizamo), a sloth, the two become unlikely traveling companions. The plot thickens when the duo finds a human infant and decides to try to return the child to its "herd." Manny slowly but surely reveals his heart of gold, while Sid continues to provide comic relief. Diego (voiced by Denis Leary), a saber-tooth tiger with ulterior motives, soon joins them in their search for the humans. Ultimately, this group of misfits becomes its own herd, learning about friendship and loyalty as they brave snow, ice, freezing temperatures, predators, hail, and even boiling lava pits. All the while, a saber-tooth squirrel, Scat, provides comic relief as he valiantly struggles with an acorn. A well-written, humorous script and endearing characters mesh well with the state-of-the-art technology and effects. Other stars lending their voices to the feature include Goran Visnjic, Jack Black, and Jane Krakowski. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

            <description>In the not-so-distant future, a portal has been discovered leading from Earth to Mars, where the government operates a research base to examine the ruins of a lost civilization; scientists are studying it, conducting experiments they perhaps shouldn't be, and trying find out what happened. Answer: nothing good. That's what Sarge (The Rock) and his unit of high-tech Marines find out the hard way when they're sent to investigate a disturbance on the base--which turns out to be nothing less than an infestation of terrifying, evil, flesh-eating monsters.DOOM, based on one of the most popular video games of all time, knows exactly what it wants to do, and wastes no time in doing it. Andrzej Bartkowiak, the director of lean, effective action flicks like ROMEO MUST DIE and EXIT WOUNDS, gets right to the meat of the movie: marines versus monsters in dark, dank corridors. The Rock brings just the right balance of bad-ass attitude and deadpan humor to the role of Sarge, while the cast's other standout is Reaper (LORD OF THE RINGS' Karl Urban), who tries to repair his strained relationship with his sister Samantha (Rosamund Pike), one of the base's scientists. They're joined by a motley crew, including the twisted Portman, intensely religious Goat, affable Duke, and newbie The Kid. While the plot differs from that of the game in a few key ways, it remains true to the spirit of the original--a no-frills fest of shooting, explosions, gore, and vicious zombies. The game was, of course, a "first-person shooter," and in an inspired moment, the movie turns itself into one for a stretch. It's exhilarating, as are several surprising twists that separate this fun, streamlined action extravaganza from lesser video game adaptations. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.

            <description>In the not-so-distant future, a portal has been discovered leading from Earth to Mars, where the government operates a research base to examine the ruins of a lost civilization; scientists are studying it, conducting experiments they perhaps shouldn't be, and trying find out what happened. Answer: nothing good. That's what Sarge (The Rock) and his unit of high-tech Marines find out the hard way when they're sent to investigate a disturbance on the base--which turns out to be nothing less than an infestation of terrifying, evil, flesh-eating monsters.DOOM, based on one of the most popular video games of all time, knows exactly what it wants to do, and wastes no time in doing it. Andrzej Bartkowiak, the director of lean, effective action flicks like ROMEO MUST DIE and EXIT WOUNDS, gets right to the meat of the movie: marines versus monsters in dark, dank corridors. The Rock brings just the right balance of bad-ass attitude and deadpan humor to the role of Sarge, while the cast's other standout is Reaper (LORD OF THE RINGS' Karl Urban), who tries to repair his strained relationship with his sister Samantha (Rosamund Pike), one of the base's scientists. They're joined by a motley crew, including the twisted Portman, intensely religious Goat, affable Duke, and newbie The Kid. While the plot differs from that of the game in a few key ways, it remains true to the spirit of the original--a no-frills fest of shooting, explosions, gore, and vicious zombies. The game was, of course, a "first-person shooter," and in an inspired moment, the movie turns itself into one for a stretch. It's exhilarating, as are several surprising twists that separate this fun, streamlined action extravaganza from lesser video game adaptations. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.

            <description>Director Sidney Pollack's diverse career sees him returning to familiar ground with THE INTERPRETER. Crafted from the same mould that saw Pollack produce the superlative political thriller THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR (1975), Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn star in a film riddled with subterfuge, recriminations, and deadly secrets. Kidman plays Silvia Broome, an interpreter who works at the UN in New York City. One night, while collecting a bag she has left behind in the building, Silvia overhears a whispered conversation in which an assassination attempt on a redoubtable African leader, named Zuwanie (Earl Cameron), is planned during his future visit to the UN. Secret service agent Tobin Keller (Penn) is assigned to provide security for Zuwanie on the forthcoming trip, and conducts an investigation when Silvia explains what she has heard. He quickly discovers that Silvia has a lengthy, troubled past as a citizen from the same country as Zuwanie, and immediately doubts her story. A series of frantic, fast-paced set pieces ensue, with Pollack beautifully capturing the architectural wonder of the UN, and staging some breathtaking scenes all over the city.Much has been made of THE INTERPRETER'S status as the first film to be shot inside the UN, and it's to Pollack's credit that he wasn't overawed by such a prospect. Making full use of the building, the director highlights the hustle and bustle of a typical day at the UN, while also shooting eerily silent late night scenes among the famous halls and corridors. As Pollack piles on the tension, Penn and Kidman deliver exemplary performances alongside a prodigious supporting cast, who do justice to an intelligently written plot designed to keep viewers guessing right up until the final moments of the film.

            <description>This slick sci-fi horror hybrid is the fourth adaptation of Jack Finney's THE BODY SNATCHERS to land on screens. Infused with modern details like text messaging and 24-hour cable news, THE INVASION updates the classic story for today's tech-centric world. After the space shuttle Patriot crashes unexpectedly, people across America begin to exhibit strange behavior. Psychiatrist Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman, BEWITCHED) begins to notice the change in those around her, including her ex-husband, Tucker Kaufman (Jeremy Northam, GOSFORD PARK), who works at the CDC. Joined by her friend Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig, CASINO ROYALE), Carol attempts to unravel the mystery as she rescues her young son.THE INVASION gives Kidman a chance to act the part of an action hero. She runs in heels, crashes cars, and shoots guns, but she looks more like a Hitchcockian blonde than a latter-day heroine. Clad in steely grays, she perfectly matches the film's sober palette of neutrals. Genre veteran Veronica Cartright gives a good performance as one of Carol's patients, who suspects that her husband isn't himself. Cartright has appeared in sci-fi classics such as THE X-FILES and ALIEN, but she also starred in Philip Kaufman's 1978 version of the story. Unlike WAR OF THE WORLDS or SIGNS, the invaders here don't arrive in UFOs or appear as little green (or gray) men. Instead, the threat in THE INVASION is so creepy because the aliens look just like everyone else. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

Instead, the threat in THE INVASION is so creepy because the aliens look just like everyone else. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

            <description>This slick sci-fi horror hybrid is the fourth adaptation of Jack Finney's THE BODY SNATCHERS to land on screens. Infused with modern details like text messaging and 24-hour cable news, THE INVASION updates the classic story for today's tech-centric world. After the space shuttle Patriot crashes unexpectedly, people across America begin to exhibit strange behavior. Psychiatrist Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman, BEWITCHED) begins to notice the change in those around her, including her ex-husband, Tucker Kaufman (Jeremy Northam, GOSFORD PARK), who works at the CDC. Joined by her friend Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig, CASINO ROYALE), Carol attempts to unravel the mystery as she rescues her young son.THE INVASION gives Kidman a chance to act the part of an action hero. She runs in heels, crashes cars, and shoots guns, but she looks more like a Hitchcockian blonde than a latter-day heroine. Clad in steely grays, she perfectly matches the film's sober palette of neutrals. Genre veteran Veronica Cartright gives a good performance as one of Carol's patients, who suspects that her husband isn't himself. Cartright has appeared in sci-fi classics such as THE X-FILES and ALIEN, but she also starred in Philip Kaufman's 1978 version of the story. Unlike WAR OF THE WORLDS or SIGNS, the invaders here don't arrive in UFOs or appear as little green (or gray) men. Instead, the threat in THE INVASION is so creepy because the aliens look just like everyone else. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

            <description>David Lynch's baroque rendering of Frank Herbert's detailed, complex, and deliberately paced epic science-fiction novel is a muddled but visually stunning affair. It's 10991, and the desert planet Dune has been taken over by the Harkonnens, oppressive conquerors who desire the precious spice that lies beneath Dune's arid sands. The story concerns the attempts of a young warrior messiah, Paul Atreides (Kyle MacLachlan), to lead the native inhabitants in an uprising against the evil empire--and battle the giant man-eating worms that guard the coveted spice.Lynch shot much more footage than ended up in the finished film, but executive producer Dino De Laurentiis didn't want a three-hour-plus sci-fi epic on his hands, so he coerced Lynch into trimming it. The result is one of cinema's most infamous cases of personal vision colliding with studio politics. Nonetheless, Lynch still manages to cram in so many visual ideas and captures the tone of the book so well that these production issues can be easily set aside once the story starts rolling. Refusing to further edit the film for television, Lynch took his name off the director and screenwriter credits. As troubling as DUNE might have been for Lynch, the experience greatly inspired 1986's brilliant BLUE VELVET, for which audiences should be thankful. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.

            <description>Navin Johnson, a none-too-bright white boy raised by a family of black sharecroppers, somehow manages to reach adulthood without ever discovering he was adopted. His parents finally tell him the truth on his birthday and, shocked by the news, he decides to head off to the big city to seek his fortune. Although he embarks on his odyssey with Candide-like optimism, Navin soon learns the cruel ways of the world as his crazy invention--a device to stop one's glasses from sliding--leads him from rags to riches and back to rags. Steve Martin is riotous in this no-holds-barred broad slapstick comedy, with Bernadette Peters playing his accepting love interest. Jackie Mason, M. Emmet Walsh, and Bill Macy are excellent in small roles, but the focus is always on Martin, who is at his goofy best in a film loaded with hysterical sight gags and a dog whose name cannot be said on television.

Emmet Walsh, and Bill Macy are excellent in small roles, but the focus is always on Martin, who is at his goofy best in a film loaded with hysterical sight gags and a dog whose name cannot be said on television.

            <description>In 2003, Syracuse surprised everyone by winning their first NCAA Basketball Championship. Though coach Jim Boeheim had taken the Orangemen there twice before, the third time proved to be the charm as freshman sensation Carmelo Anthony and his cohorts held Kansas back to take the title. This DVD lets you relive all the magic moments of this historic tournament with a recap, highlights, exclusive interviews with the players and coaches, and a special condensed version of the Championship game.

            <description>Cherubic and pink-haired, Kelly Osbourne would be hard to miss even if she were not the daughter of heavy metal king Ozzy Osbourne. After skyrocketing to notoriety when her crazy (yet oddly normal) family began starring in MTV's hit reality television show THE OSBOURNES, this young hipster launched a solo pop career. PAPA DON'T PREACH, a cover of the hit 1980's Madonna tune, is her first single. Here, on this DVD EP, the Nancy Sinatra-inspired video for the tune is included, as well as a behind the scenes look at its making.  Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.

            <description>Deux ?tudiants ?cras?s par un train en sauvant un SDF se retrouvent dans une pi?ce avec d?autres personnes clamant ?tre mortes quelques minutes auparavant. Envoy?s pour remplir des missions ?tranges, ils semblent n??tre vu de personne. Une sph?re noire, qui leur fournit mat?riel et instructions, semble ?tre la source de tous ces myst?res. Particuli?rement violente cette production r?cente n?est pas ? mettre entre toutes les mains. Adaptation soft mais efficace de l??uvre d?origine, cette s?rie est un savant m?lange d?action gore, de thriller psychologique et de SF.</description>

            <description>Dans la Gr?ce antique, l'enl?vement d'H?l?ne, reine de Sparte, par Paris, prince de Troie, est une insulte que le roi M?n?las ne peut supporter. L'honneur familial ?tant en jeu, Agamemnon, fr?re de M?n?las et puissant roi de Myc?nes, r?unit toutes les arm?es grecques afin de faire sortir H?l?ne de Troie. Mais en r?alit?, la sauvegarde de l'honneur familial n'est qu'un pr?texte pris par Agamemnon pour cacher sa terrible avidit?. Celui-ci cherche en fait ? contr?ler Troie et ? agrandir son vaste empire. Aucune arm?e n'a jamais r?ussi ? p?n?trer dans la cit? fortifi?e, sur laquelle veillent le roi Priam et le prince Hector. L'issue de la guerre de Troie d?pendra notamment d'un homme, Achille, connu comme le plus grand guerrier de son ?poque. Arrogant, rebelle, et r?put? invicible, celui-ci n'a d'attache pour rien ni personne si ce n'est sa propre gloire...</description>

            <description>Matt Murdock est un jeune avocat id?aliste. Il est aussi aveugle. Mais surtout, la nuit, il d?fend les faibles sous le nom et le costume de Daredevil. Il a cependant encore du mal ? faire la diff?rence entre l?auto-d?fense et la justice. Entre dans sa vie la fille d?un milliardaire, Elektra. Leur existence va ?tre boulevers?e par un m?fait de trop du myst?rieux Ca?d, v?ritable Parrain de New York?Hulk, X-men, Spider-man et bient?t les 4 Fantastiques : l?industrie hollywoodienne a enfin saisi le potentiel d?adaptation de l??uvre de Stan Lee, v?ritable mine d?or pour sc?naristes en mal d?inspiration. Interpr?t? par Ben Affleck qui r?vait d?un r?le en costume, ce Dardevil est un bijou visuel (le point de vue du h?ros aveugle, sorte de vision radar bleut?e permet un ?tirement de l?espace), seul regret, le costume d?Elektra qui n?est pas la combinaison moulante int?grale violette qu?elle porte dans les anciens num?ros de Strange. L??dition collector regorge de bonus destin?s aux fans du super h?ros : Le monde de Daredevil, L?art de Daredevil, une galerie de photos supervis?e par Stan Lee, les tests de Jennifer Garner et des s?quences en multi-angles.</description>

            <description>Sent to eliminate a gun-running camp in Central America, United States Major Dutch Schaeffer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his commandos get more than they bargained for when they cross paths with a mysterious assassin. As members of their unit begin to disappear, Dutch, Dillon (Carl Weathers), and Blain (Jesse Ventura) conclude that whatever is hunting them is not of this earth. Every attempt at a tactical defense is a defeated for Dutch and company and it is only in the last stretch of their race to safety that their suspicions are confirmed and they encounter the alien nimrod face to face.A summer box office smash, 1987's PREDATOR re-ignited an old trend of movies depicting aliens invading earth that began decades earlier with films like WAR OF THE WORLDS and INVADERS FROM MARS. McTiernan does a miraculous job of directing the "invisible" Predator. Furthermore, the special effects, which are stunningly subtle and never boisterous, make PREDATOR a strikingly contemporary sci-fi effort even amid today's techno-thrillers.

Every attempt at a tactical defense is a defeated for Dutch and company and it is only in the last stretch of their race to safety that their suspicions are confirmed and they encounter the alien nimrod face to face.A summer box office smash, 1987's PREDATOR re-ignited an old trend of movies depicting aliens invading earth that began decades earlier with films like WAR OF THE WORLDS and INVADERS FROM MARS. McTiernan does a miraculous job of directing the "invisible" Predator. Furthermore, the special effects, which are stunningly subtle and never boisterous, make PREDATOR a strikingly contemporary sci-fi effort even amid today's techno-thrillers.

            <description>Sent to eliminate a gun-running camp in Central America, United States Major Dutch Schaeffer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his commandos get more than they bargained for when they cross paths with a mysterious assassin. As members of their unit begin to disappear, Dutch, Dillon (Carl Weathers), and Blain (Jesse Ventura) conclude that whatever is hunting them is not of this earth. Every attempt at a tactical defense is a defeated for Dutch and company and it is only in the last stretch of their race to safety that their suspicions are confirmed and they encounter the alien nimrod face to face.A summer box office smash, 1987's PREDATOR re-ignited an old trend of movies depicting aliens invading earth that began decades earlier with films like WAR OF THE WORLDS and INVADERS FROM MARS. McTiernan does a miraculous job of directing the "invisible" Predator. Furthermore, the special effects, which are stunningly subtle and never boisterous, make PREDATOR a strikingly contemporary sci-fi effort even amid today's techno-thrillers.

            <description>Sent to eliminate a gun-running camp in Central America, United States Major Dutch Schaeffer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his commandos get more than they bargained for when they cross paths with a mysterious assassin. As members of their unit begin to disappear, Dutch, Dillon (Carl Weathers), and Blain (Jesse Ventura) conclude that whatever is hunting them is not of this earth. Every attempt at a tactical defense is a defeated for Dutch and company and it is only in the last stretch of their race to safety that their suspicions are confirmed and they encounter the alien nimrod face to face.A summer box office smash, 1987's PREDATOR re-ignited an old trend of movies depicting aliens invading earth that began decades earlier with films like WAR OF THE WORLDS and INVADERS FROM MARS. McTiernan does a miraculous job of directing the "invisible" Predator. Furthermore, the special effects, which are stunningly subtle and never boisterous, make PREDATOR a strikingly contemporary sci-fi effort even amid today's techno-thrillers.

            <description>A family film for the Instant Messenger age, RV takes a humorous look at a mostly functional suburban family's attempt to get away from it all on a rare vacation. The always hilarious Robin Williams plays Bob Munro, a beaten-down middle manager who feels alienated from the family he works so hard to keep comfortable. Upon his insistence, the Munro family rents an RV and embarks on a search for quality time in the land of Manifest Destiny. With his frustrated wife Jamie (the always stellar Cheryl Hines of TV's CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM), rapper-wannabe son Carl (Josh Hutcherson), and angsty daughter Cassie (Joanna Levesque, best known as a tween pop singer), la famiglia Munro is Westward Ho. However, white-collar Bob's lack of adeptness at handling the monstrous vehicle causes plenty of amusing chaos. Thank God for the kindness of strangers--in  this case, a couple of endearing oddballs played by Jeff Daniels (who proved his comedic chops in the DUMB AND DUMBER films) and Kristin Chenoweth. As Travis and Mary Jo, two obsessive RV-ers with a penchant for barbecues, beer, and yodeling, they serve as the Middle-American heart and soul of the film, much smarter and savvier than cultural stereotypes write them off as being. Seasoned comedy director Barry Sonnenfield (MEN IN BLACK, WILD, WILD WEST) proves that he has mastered the intelligent comedy, and Williams, particularly in moments that are improvised, proves his brilliance once again. But it is the uniformly excellent supporting cast, in particular a knee-slapping turn by Will Arnett (Gob on TV's ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT), that makes RV so memorable. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.

            <description>A family film for the Instant Messenger age, RV takes a humorous look at a mostly functional suburban family's attempt to get away from it all on a rare vacation. The always hilarious Robin Williams plays Bob Munro, a beaten-down middle manager who feels alienated from the family he works so hard to keep comfortable. Upon his insistence, the Munro family rents an RV and embarks on a search for quality time in the land of Manifest Destiny. With his frustrated wife Jamie (the always stellar Cheryl Hines of TV's CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM), rapper-wannabe son Carl (Josh Hutcherson), and angsty daughter Cassie (Joanna Levesque, best known as a tween pop singer), la famiglia Munro is Westward Ho. However, white-collar Bob's lack of adeptness at handling the monstrous vehicle causes plenty of amusing chaos. Thank God for the kindness of strangers--in  this case, a couple of endearing oddballs played by Jeff Daniels (who proved his comedic chops in the DUMB AND DUMBER films) and Kristin Chenoweth. As Travis and Mary Jo, two obsessive RV-ers with a penchant for barbecues, beer, and yodeling, they serve as the Middle-American heart and soul of the film, much smarter and savvier than cultural stereotypes write them off as being. Seasoned comedy director Barry Sonnenfield (MEN IN BLACK, WILD, WILD WEST) proves that he has mastered the intelligent comedy, and Williams, particularly in moments that are improvised, proves his brilliance once again. But it is the uniformly excellent supporting cast, in particular a knee-slapping turn by Will Arnett (Gob on TV's ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT), that makes RV so memorable. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.

            <description>Based on the novel by Thomas Harris, RED DRAGON stars Edward Norton as Will Graham, the intuitive FBI agent who captured the notorious Hannibal "the Cannibal" Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). When another killer, dubbed "the Tooth Fairy," begins a series of bizarre, seemingly random killings, the now-retired Graham reluctantly agrees to aid in the investigation. In order to get further into the mind set of the murderer, Graham consults the imprisoned Lecter, who offers cryptic commentary that the determined agent must decipher. However, the Tooth Fairy himself, Francis Dolarhyde (Ralph Fiennes), is also in contact with the infamous epicurean, and the case soon develops into a deadly cat-and-mouse game, with Lecter deviously playing both sides.Rather than attempting to remake MANHUNTER--Michael Mann's 1986 adaptation of RED DRAGON starring William L. Petersen as Graham and Brian Cox as Lecter--or recreate the monster-movie atmosphere of HANNIBAL, director Brett Ratner wisely chooses to focus on the character-driven specifics of the first Hannibal Lecter novel. As in THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, the unblinking Hopkins makes the most out of his screen time as the eloquent yet terrifying former forensic psychologist. Norton is excellently understated as the talented investigator, while Fiennes explores the full range of his conflicted character, from a sensitive man-child to a methodical psychopath. These key performances are enhanced by strong supporting turns by Emily Watson, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Harvey Keitel, and Mary-Louise Parker. Ratner's capable direction extends to his choice of crew, which includes SILENCE OF THE LAMBS screenwriter Ted Tally and production designer Kristen Zea, as well as MANHUNTER cinematographer Dante Spinotti. This collection of talent combines to create an engaging and eerie thriller that brings the Hopkins-as-Lecter trilogy full circle. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.

            <description>E.M. Forster's 1908 novel, A ROOM WITH A VIEW, is adapted for the screen by director James Ivory in this beautifully lighthearted tale of Edwardian manners. Helena Bonham Carter stars as a young Englishwoman, Lucy Honeychurch. When Lucy and her spinster chaperone, Charlotte Bartlett (Maggie Smith), travel to Florence, they meet an unconventional Englishman, Mr. Emerson (Denholm Elliott), and his romantically unhappy son, George (Julian Sands). After George makes the grievous mistake of kissing Lucy during a picnic in the Florentine hills, Charlotte rushes her back to England. Safely home, Lucy becomes engaged to the stiff, very proper Cecil (Daniel Day-Lewis), but after finding out the Emersons have moved close by, Lucy has a hard time ignoring her attraction to the unsuitable George. Producer Ismail Merchant considered A ROOM WITH A VIEW Merchant Ivory's first genuine blockbuster, and it enjoyed more popular success than any previous Merchant Ivory film. Screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala was awarded an Academy Award for her screenplay, and the film itself was nominated for Best Picture. Director James Ivory's tale also features British movie icons Judi Dench and Simon Callow. A ROOM WITH A VIEW was the first of three Forster novels (the other two were MAURICE and HOWARDS END) adapted by Merchant Ivory Productions. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.

            <description>E.M. Forster's 1908 novel, A ROOM WITH A VIEW, is adapted for the screen by director James Ivory in this beautifully lighthearted tale of Edwardian manners. Helena Bonham Carter stars as a young Englishwoman, Lucy Honeychurch. When Lucy and her spinster chaperone, Charlotte Bartlett (Maggie Smith), travel to Florence, they meet an unconventional Englishman, Mr. Emerson (Denholm Elliott), and his romantically unhappy son, George (Julian Sands). After George makes the grievous mistake of kissing Lucy during a picnic in the Florentine hills, Charlotte rushes her back to England. Safely home, Lucy becomes engaged to the stiff, very proper Cecil (Daniel Day-Lewis), but after finding out the Emersons have moved close by, Lucy has a hard time ignoring her attraction to the unsuitable George. Producer Ismail Merchant considered A ROOM WITH A VIEW Merchant Ivory's first genuine blockbuster, and it enjoyed more popular success than any previous Merchant Ivory film. Screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala was awarded an Academy Award for her screenplay, and the film itself was nominated for Best Picture. Director James Ivory's tale also features British movie icons Judi Dench and Simon Callow. A ROOM WITH A VIEW was the first of three Forster novels (the other two were MAURICE and HOWARDS END) adapted by Merchant Ivory Productions. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.

            <description>Richard Linklater's adaptation of Philip K. Dick's classic novel is a challenging, mind-bending experience that cautions about the dangers of excessive drug use as well as the government's capacity to abuse and manipulate power. Using the same interpolated rotoscoping technique that Linklater employed in 2001's WAKING LIFE, the film is an animated, trippy descent into one man's unraveling mind. Set in the not-too-distant future where a new drug, substance D, has created an epidemic, A SCANNER DARKLY charts the mental unraveling of Bob Arctor (Keanu Reeves). Arctor is an undercover cop who has been assigned to track a group of individuals who include the druggily verbose Barris (Robert Downey Jr.), the hyper-intense Luckman (Woody Harrelson), the ultra-paranoid Freck (Rory Cochrane), and the beautiful Donna (Winona Ryder). As the film unfolds and Arctor finds himself abusing substance D in order to maintain his faÃ§ade, his mind begins to spin out of control, to the point where he doesn't know what's real and what isn't. Eventually, the truth comes out, leaving Arctor even more numbed. Linklater's surprisingly faithful adaptation of Dick's novel blends humor, drama, and Bob Sabiston's striking animation to deliver a thought-provoking film that will leave viewers as dazed as the film's protagonist.

            <description>Chris O'Donnell stars as Charlie Simms, a young and innocent scholarship student at an exclusive prep school in New Hampshire who agrees to look after Lt. Col. Frank Slade (Al Pacino), a blind retired army officer, to earn extra money over the Thanksgiving holiday. Frank is a cantankerous and cynical bully who completely suprises Charlie with his plans for their weekend. He has bought them tickets to New York, booked a suite at the Waldorf, rented a limousine, and has big plans for a wild weekend in the Big Apple. Before Charlie realizes what he has gotten into, he is accompanying the colonel around Manhattan as they begin their wild and eye-opening adventures that include a fast-paced test drive in a Ferrari and a tango with a beautiful woman (Gabrielle Anwar). Frank's passion is women; he waxes lyrically on their bodies, scent, and sensuality, and gradually Charlie becomes aware of the sentimental romantic buried deep within the lonely man's heart. Charlie and Frank's growing relationship is the core of the film; Frank teaches Charlie how to see, and Charlie teaches Frank how to feel in this heart-wrenching and heartwarming comedy. Al Pacino is simply stunning as Frank Slade, relying on his vocal power and strong physicality to carry across a complex range of emotions. He is both intolerable and completely lovable in this Oscar-winning role of a lifetime. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

            <description>Everyone's favorite plastic slasher doll, Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif), returns for a fifth installment of this popular horror series. Apparently Chucky and his equally murderous bride, Tiffany (voiced by Jennifer Tilly), had a child, which has grown up in a cage as part of a heavy-metal ventriloquist act in England. Eventually it (one never learns its exact gender) escapes to Los Angeles to revive mom and pop, whose doll corpses are being used for a movie based on their previous killing spree. Jennifer Tilly shows up as herself, and she's great--hamming it up as a floozy actress so desperate for the part in rapper Redman's latest film that she lures him home for a casting couch tryst, with hilarious (and fatal) results. Meanwhile, the child of Chucky is horrified by the violent murders its parents are so fond of committing and, with a little help from a 12-step book, tries to help them kick the homicide habit. Of course it's hard when there are so many deserving targets around, including John Waters as a scuzzy paparazzi. In sum, this is one crazy sequel; it's got a refreshing lack of morals, a light heart, and a clever script with a lot of great insider jokes for buffs. The gore is extreme though, including eviscerations, beheadings, melting flesh, and other raunchy business that makes its R rating well-earned (no true Chucky fan would have it any other way, of course). Rappers Eminem and Big Pun contributed tracks to the score. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

            <description>With soaring photography that circles from above then swoops in for the action, TROY is Wolfgang Petersen's majestic presentation of the classic Greek legend. It tells the story of an epic battle over Helen (Diane Kruger), the queen of Sparta, who is kidnapped by her lover Paris (Orlando Bloom), the prince of Troy. This infuriates Helen's husband Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson), whose brother Agamemnon (Brian Cox) convinces him to invade Troy. They recruit Achilles (Brad Pitt), the best warrior in Greece, whose bravery, quick feet, and remarkable swordsmanship (not to mention tanned biceps, short kilts, and blond locks) have earned him a reputation that is almost as impressive as his ego. Achilles agrees to fight for Sparta, if only for the fame it will bring him. Even Achilles's mother, in a touching scene, advises him to forget mortal achievements and become a hero who will be remembered throughout history. Along with the invasion of Troy, a series of duels must also be fought: Paris, who is heartbreaking in his lovestruck naivetÃ©, must go up against the enraged Menelaus, and Achilles must settle a score with Hector (Eric Bana), who is fiercely dedicated to protecting his brother Paris and their father, the frail king Priam (Peter O'Toole). When the war finally ignites in its massive proportions, the action is awesome. And as the increasingly dramatic events play out, TROY earns its own timeless reputation among other action-adventure epics such as GLADIATOR and SPARTACUS. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.

            <description>With soaring photography that circles from above then swoops in for the action, TROY is Wolfgang Petersen's majestic presentation of the classic Greek legend. It tells the story of an epic battle over Helen (Diane Kruger), the queen of Sparta, who is kidnapped by her lover Paris (Orlando Bloom), the prince of Troy. This infuriates Helen's husband Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson), whose brother Agamemnon (Brian Cox) convinces him to invade Troy. They recruit Achilles (Brad Pitt), the best warrior in Greece, whose bravery, quick feet, and remarkable swordsmanship (not to mention tanned biceps, short kilts, and blond locks) have earned him a reputation that is almost as impressive as his ego. Achilles agrees to fight for Sparta, if only for the fame it will bring him. Even Achilles's mother, in a touching scene, advises him to forget mortal achievements and become a hero who will be remembered throughout history. Along with the invasion of Troy, a series of duels must also be fought: Paris, who is heartbreaking in his lovestruck naivetÃ©, must go up against the enraged Menelaus, and Achilles must settle a score with Hector (Eric Bana), who is fiercely dedicated to protecting his brother Paris and their father, the frail king Priam (Peter O'Toole). When the war finally ignites in its massive proportions, the action is awesome. And as the increasingly dramatic events play out, TROY earns its own timeless reputation among other action-adventure epics such as GLADIATOR and SPARTACUS. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.

            <description>With soaring photography that circles from above then swoops in for the action, TROY is Wolfgang Petersen's majestic presentation of the classic Greek legend. It tells the story of an epic battle over Helen (Diane Kruger), the queen of Sparta, who is kidnapped by her lover Paris (Orlando Bloom), the prince of Troy. This infuriates Helen's husband Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson), whose brother Agamemnon (Brian Cox) convinces him to invade Troy. They recruit Achilles (Brad Pitt), the best warrior in Greece, whose bravery, quick feet, and remarkable swordsmanship (not to mention tanned biceps, short kilts, and blond locks) have earned him a reputation that is almost as impressive as his ego. Achilles agrees to fight for Sparta, if only for the fame it will bring him. Even Achilles's mother, in a touching scene, advises him to forget mortal achievements and become a hero who will be remembered throughout history. Along with the invasion of Troy, a series of duels must also be fought: Paris, who is heartbreaking in his lovestruck naivetÃ©, must go up against the enraged Menelaus, and Achilles must settle a score with Hector (Eric Bana), who is fiercely dedicated to protecting his brother Paris and their father, the frail king Priam (Peter O'Toole). When the war finally ignites in its massive proportions, the action is awesome. And as the increasingly dramatic events play out, TROY earns its own timeless reputation among other action-adventure epics such as GLADIATOR and SPARTACUS. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.

            <description>V FOR VENDETTA: From DC comics and the Wachowski Brothers (THE MATRIX) comes this tale of revolution in an England of the future, one gone fearful and fascist; anyone different, from homosexuals to free thinking artists, is "black bagged" and subjected to torture and inhumane medical experiments. Hugo Weaving stars as V, the mysterious knife-carrying masked avenger who has lightning reflexes, lots of explosives, and intentions to blow up Parliament. He's also on a vendetta against the evil powermongers who made him the lonely monster he is. Natalie Portman is the innocent waif who saves him and winds up hiding out in his nifty secret lair, which is filled with forbidden books, art, and a jukebox that plays Cat Power and Julie London's "Cry Me a River." Meanwhile, there's a hangdog police inspector (Stephen Rea) picking up their trail, and a plethora of evil British government types regularly bullied into action by the intensely odious "Grand Chancellor" (John Hurt). Director James McTiegue keeps all these events unfolding at a hypnotically rhythmic pace, like the burning of a long, unstoppable fuse. Some may balk at the film's seemingly pro-explosive, pro-terrorist stance, but to look deeper is to realize the film merely provides a funhouse mirror of our actual messed-up world, something that is true of all the best science fiction. V certainly fits that category, especially with Natalie Portman in the lead, as lovely and riveting an actress as a beleaguered nation could ever hope for. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.

            <description>V FOR VENDETTA: From DC comics and the Wachowski Brothers (THE MATRIX) comes this tale of revolution in an England of the future, one gone fearful and fascist; anyone different, from homosexuals to free thinking artists, is "black bagged" and subjected to torture and inhumane medical experiments. Hugo Weaving stars as V, the mysterious knife-carrying masked avenger who has lightning reflexes, lots of explosives, and intentions to blow up Parliament. He's also on a vendetta against the evil powermongers who made him the lonely monster he is. Natalie Portman is the innocent waif who saves him and winds up hiding out in his nifty secret lair, which is filled with forbidden books, art, and a jukebox that plays Cat Power and Julie London's "Cry Me a River." Meanwhile, there's a hangdog police inspector (Stephen Rea) picking up their trail, and a plethora of evil British government types regularly bullied into action by the intensely odious "Grand Chancellor" (John Hurt). Director James McTiegue keeps all these events unfolding at a hypnotically rhythmic pace, like the burning of a long, unstoppable fuse. Some may balk at the film's seemingly pro-explosive, pro-terrorist stance, but to look deeper is to realize the film merely provides a funhouse mirror of our actual messed-up world, something that is true of all the best science fiction. V certainly fits that category, especially with Natalie Portman in the lead, as lovely and riveting an actress as a beleaguered nation could ever hope for. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.

            <description>This sun scorched, bullet-blasted South Central L.A. story follows the car- and corpse-strewn trail of an ex-con turned security guard O2 (Tyrese Gibson), who gets carjacked while his son is still asleep in the backseat. The thugs hold the child for ransom, and O2 has 48 hours to come up with a hundred grand. His only lead in getting the kid back is Coco (Meagan Good) the cutie who distracted him at the traffic light. Together they bicker, fall in love, and launch a plan to take down a vicious gang leader named Meat (The Game) while they roll along on a bank-robbing spree. Director Vondie Curtis-Hall keeps the action humming and swathes his gritty South Central locations in a thick haze of urban grime and chaotic spontaneity, making it reminiscent of 1970s cult classics like BLACK CAESAR and THE WARRIORS. Tyrese is more than up for the job here as the tough but tender O2; he and the very sexy Meagan Good generate major onscreen chemistry. Larenz Tate plays O2's dope-head cousin, and Kimora Lee Simmons has a funny cameo as a fencer of hot designer dresses. Her husband, Russell Simmons, was one of the producers.

            <description>Kat Ellis's (Debra Messing) worst nightmare is about to come true. Not only is her younger, half-sister, Amy (Amy Adams), getting married before her, but to add insult to injury, the groom's (Jack Davenport) best man is Kat's ex-fiancÃ©e, Jeffrey (Jeremy Sheffield). Two years after being dumped, Kat is a single New Yorker and can't bear to attend the festivities at her parent's London home alone, so she does the next best thing: she hires an escort to play her boyfriend. Her rented date, Nick (Dermot Mulroney), fits the bill perfectly. He's handsome, intelligent, well spoken, intuitive, and a perfect gentleman--a virtual bargain at $6,000. The plan? Make Kat's ex sorry that he ever let her go.But the plan takes a turn when Kat finds herself attracted to Nick, and the feeling seems to be mutual. But will their business arrangement stand in the way of a relationship? And just what is it that Kat's ex has been dying to tell her? Messing is endearing as Kat, who seems to be simultaneously bewildered and bemused by her situation. Mulroney, meanwhile, is at his most charming as Nick. Clare Kilner (HOW TO DEAL) directs this romantic comedy set in London and the English countryside, which also features Holland Taylor as Kat's slightly overbearing mother and Peter Egan as her loving stepfather. Sarah Parish is a hoot as the sisters' bawdy British cousin. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

            <description>In the 1920s, Thomas Edison speculated that a device would be created which would allow humans to conduct conversations with the dead. In the 1970s, Sarah Estep picked up some mysterious voices on her husband's reel-to-reel tape recorder, and set up the American Association of Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) to help track the phenomenon. In 2005, following a welter of evidence gathered by Estep and others, EVP forms the backbone for director Geoffrey Sax's shocking feature film WHITE NOISE.Architect Jonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton) has little time to mourn the passing of his wife Anna (Chandra West) when he starts receiving signals from her. A faint sound of her voice is caught by Rivers in radio static on the night of her death, followed by incessant cell phone calls coming from Anna's old number. Rivers is convinced he can hear Anna's voice saying "go, Jon" to him in the resulting calls. With a little help from expert EVP practitioner Raymond Price (Ian McNeice), Rivers contacts Anna and begins a hazy dialect with her. From the garbled dialogue Rivers receives, he deduces that Anna is sending him to save the lives of people who are about to die. This joins Rivers, in his plight, with a former client of Price's, Sarah Tate (Deborah Kara Unger). However, meddling with messages from the dead leads the pair into a world of trouble, producing some startlingly anxious moments, and a spine-chilling forewarning of the possible consequences facing real-life users of EVP.

            <description>Neil LaBute's THE WICKER MAN stars Nicholas Cage as Edward Malus, a policeman thrust into some dangerous detective work by a series of strange events that begin with a horrific car crash. This incident leaves the cop haunted, with images of the accident replaying in his heavily medicated mind. Edward's hiatus from work is interrupted when he receives a mysterious letter from his ex-fiancÃ©, pleading with him to help find her missing daughter, Rowan. Against his better judgment, Edward travels to the remote, privately owned island of Summerisle, home to a close-knit, secretive community with a clear dislike for outsiders. Considering Edward an intruder, the Sisters of Summerisle offer little information regarding the missing girl. Edward is at a loss, finding even his ex-love Willow to be little help. With vacant eyes and a strange, listless way about her, Willow should be the first of many red flags to send Edward running. But in firm horror-movie tradition, the seasoned cop throws caution to the winds, staying in the place longer than seems smart.This 2006 remake veers away from the 1973 film in several key ways. For one, it replaces the original's eerily upbeat folk soundtrack with a tasteful Angelo Badalamenti score. With a mild PG-13 rating, the 2006 version is relatively tame compared to the original. While the 1973 film freely mixed pornographic elements with horror themes and musical numbers, the new film confines itself to horror, abandoning that strange mixture of genres that made Anthony Shaffer's film a cult classic. While LaBute's film adds a back-story and romantic interest, it requires equal suspension of disbelief. Despite their differences, both films end in the same disturbing way, leaving an indelible image that may haunt viewers long after the credits roll. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.

            <description>As a counterpoint to the heroic horde of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, the aging gunmen of Sam Peckinpah's masterpiece break the very laws of honor which bind them in this bloody and meditative tale of the American West--widely considered to be the self-conscious nail in the coffin of the genre. William Holden, Robert Ryan, and Ernest Borgnine star as the leaders of a grizzled crew of Texan bandits who ride to Mexico, where, one by one, they are unceremoniously slaughtered by a Mexican revolutionary.The western, a genre steeped in legend and the concept of loyalty, was a dying breed when Sam Peckinpah unleashed this amoral and violent opus. Along with BONNIE AND CLYDE, it ushered in a new breed of Hollywood film, depicting a harsh reality where lines between right and wrong became blurred. Peckinpah brilliantly used aging Western stars such as Ryan and Holden to convey this passing of the cinematic torch. The film brought issues of violence and morality in movies to the forefront of American film criticism. Instead of appreciating the film as a critique of brutal violence, many critics responded by rejecting what they saw as a superfluous spectacle of dead bodies. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.

            <description>As a counterpoint to the heroic horde of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, the aging gunmen of Sam Peckinpah's masterpiece break the very laws of honor which bind them in this bloody and meditative tale of the American West--widely considered to be the self-conscious nail in the coffin of the genre. William Holden, Robert Ryan, and Ernest Borgnine star as the leaders of a grizzled crew of Texan bandits who ride to Mexico, where, one by one, they are unceremoniously slaughtered by a Mexican revolutionary.The western, a genre steeped in legend and the concept of loyalty, was a dying breed when Sam Peckinpah unleashed this amoral and violent opus. Along with BONNIE AND CLYDE, it ushered in a new breed of Hollywood film, depicting a harsh reality where lines between right and wrong became blurred. Peckinpah brilliantly used aging Western stars such as Ryan and Holden to convey this passing of the cinematic torch. The film brought issues of violence and morality in movies to the forefront of American film criticism. Instead of appreciating the film as a critique of brutal violence, many critics responded by rejecting what they saw as a superfluous spectacle of dead bodies. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.

            <description>WOLF CREEK is a grim and disturbing horror film, based on actual events in the TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE vein. It's also beautifully shot, with director Greg McLean (in his feature film debut) making the otherworldly majesty of Australia's outback emerge as a part of the story. Cassandra Magrath and Kesti Morassi play the two young British girls traveling with their Aussie friend, Ben (Nathan Phillips), to Wolf Creek, the remote location of a giant meteor crater. When their car breaks down, a jovial, Crocodile Dundee-type named John Jarrett (Mick Taylor) offers to tow them to his even more remote auto camp. What happens next ensures, among other things, that surviving audience members will never think of Crocodile Dundee in quite the same happy way again.In addition to McLean's painterly use of scenery in establishing mood, the film benefits from the slow, methodical buildup of character detail; the actors are given space to develop a believable rapport, something all too rare in this kind of film. The characters are people, not stock slasher-film types, and this makes the ensuing scenes of cruelty and violence all the more unbearable. Some viewers may find it all too excessive and disturbing, but there should be no doubt that this is one carefully crafted, genuinely scary horror film, and a promising start for a fresh new filmmaking talent.

            <description>In this film that epitomizes the American love for baseball, Ray Kinsella, a struggling Iowa farmer (Kevin Costner), obeys a mysterious voice in his cornfield that tells him to replace part of his crop with a baseball diamond, resulting in the magical meeting of baseball heroes from the past, including Shoeless Joe Jackson, and the seven other Chicago White Sox players who were suspended for purposefully losing the 1919 World Series. Even after building the diamond, Ray continues to hear voices, and seeks the help of a hermit-like author in sorting out the mystery, which allows the confrontation of ghosts of other sorts.

            <description>Director Sam Raimi follows up his 1998 hit A SIMPLE PLAN with a movie that completes Mr. Costner's unofficial trilogy of baseball films. Told almost entirely in flashback, the film concerns an already legendary 40 year-old pitcher, Billy Chapel, pitching the last game of his career that also marks the end of what has been, at best, a mediocre season. Going up against the Yankees, Billy remembers, while on the mound, his failed affair with the woman he still loves (Preston). As the game unfolds and it becomes apparent that he's on track to pitch a perfect game, Billy begins to wonder if he can win her back, and if his ailing arm can make it through nine innings.

            <description>Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST is transformed in this landmark science-fiction film. Spacemen travel to a planet ruled by Dr. Edward Morbius (Walter Pidgeon), who has built a kingdom with his daughter and obedient robot Robby. The good doctor is plagued by his mad quest for knowledge through his "brain booster" machine, and by Freudian "monsters from the id" as his daughter discovers other men and learns to kiss.

            <description>When their beloved foster mother is killed in a holdup, four tough brothers reunite in their old Detroit neighborhood with revenge on their minds. Mark Wahlberg plays the brawl-hungry leader, Bobby. His brother, Angel (Tyrese Gibson), is a rowdy sailor with a high-strung Latina girlfriend (Sofi Vergara). Garrett Hedlun plays the young rock &amp; roller of the clan. And Outkast's Andre 3000 is the family man whose tenuous mob connection may link him to the killers. Director John Singleton ably blends his action skills (SHAFT, 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS) and his gift for capturing the warm heart at the center of violent urban masculinity (BABY BOY, BOYZ N THE HOOD) to create a cooked-to-perfection gangsta stew. A soundtrack jammed with 1970s Motown classics roots everything firmly in the gritty tradition of the best of that decade's blaxploitation and urban revenge thrillers. Action highlights include a skidding car chase through snowy streets, some rough street hockey, and a bullet-intensive neighborhood shoot-out. With its talented, likeable cast, clever plotting, and sharp dialogue, this is a real crowd-pleaser that nonetheless doesn't shy away from depictions of street violence. There's not an ounce of fat on it--no extraneous romance, and no going "straight" at the end. Terrence Howard (HUSTLE &amp; FLOW) is the well-meaning but ineffectual detective who tries to put a lid on the boys' rebelliousness. The spirits of Dirty Harry and Charles Bronson should be proud, and action fans will be well pleased. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

            <description>When their beloved foster mother is killed in a holdup, four tough brothers reunite in their old Detroit neighborhood with revenge on their minds. Mark Wahlberg plays the brawl-hungry leader, Bobby. His brother, Angel (Tyrese Gibson), is a rowdy sailor with a high-strung Latina girlfriend (Sofi Vergara). Garrett Hedlun plays the young rock &amp; roller of the clan. And Outkast's Andre 3000 is the family man whose tenuous mob connection may link him to the killers. Director John Singleton ably blends his action skills (SHAFT, 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS) and his gift for capturing the warm heart at the center of violent urban masculinity (BABY BOY, BOYZ N THE HOOD) to create a cooked-to-perfection gangsta stew. A soundtrack jammed with 1970s Motown classics roots everything firmly in the gritty tradition of the best of that decade's blaxploitation and urban revenge thrillers. Action highlights include a skidding car chase through snowy streets, some rough street hockey, and a bullet-intensive neighborhood shoot-out. With its talented, likeable cast, clever plotting, and sharp dialogue, this is a real crowd-pleaser that nonetheless doesn't shy away from depictions of street violence. There's not an ounce of fat on it--no extraneous romance, and no going "straight" at the end. Terrence Howard (HUSTLE &amp; FLOW) is the well-meaning but ineffectual detective who tries to put a lid on the boys' rebelliousness. The spirits of Dirty Harry and Charles Bronson should be proud, and action fans will be well pleased. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

            <description>Based on the best-selling book by H.G. Bissinger, Peter Berg's gritty, powerful drama tells the true story of a small Texas town in which high school football is the only thing that matters. Set in 1988, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS opens on the first day of practice for the Odessa Permian Panthers. Under intense pressure and scrutiny from the town's residents, head coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton) nonetheless maintains a calm faÃ§ade. His star player, Boobie Miles (Derek Luke), is a running back with unlimited potential, but the rest of the team is undersized and lacking killer instinct--especially quarterback Mike Winchell (Lucas Black), who's shy and short of confidence, and Don Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund), who is tormented by his father (Tim McGraw) for being too soft. When Boobie goes down on opening day with a career threatening knee injury, the season appears to be over. But Gaines won't give up, and neither will the rest of his feisty players.Billy Bob Thornton delivers another outstanding performance in Berg's impassioned drama, as do the film's young actors (most notably Luke, Black, and Hedlund). Tobias Schliessler's fuel-injected photography and Explosion in the Sky's electrifying score make FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS an even more spectacular movie-going experience. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.

            <description>This epic film from writer-director Ron Maxwell chronicles the early events of the American Civil War. It's a prequel to his earlier GETTYSBURG, with some of the same cast, and is part of a planned trilogy. Stephen Lang plays Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson, the famous (and deeply religious) Confederate general who, along with fellow General Robert E. Lee (Robert Duvall), must weigh the mighty consequences of his actions, as each battle costs the lives of thousands of men. Over on the Union side there's Jeff Daniels as Colonel Joshua Chamberlain, who, like Jackson and Lee, is fond of making long, poetic speeches to his troops. Beginning with the start of the war and ending with Jackson's death, the film chronicles the three main battles leading up to Gettysburg, using their actual locations and thousands of actual Civil War re-enactors as extras. Maxwell pays careful attention to authentic period detail as he chronicles the minutiae of the generals' domestic lives in the intervals between the harrowing battle scenes. While a little on the long side, the end result should serve as an invaluable document for history buffs. Mogul Ted Turner was an executive producer and appears in a small role.

            <description>This epic film from writer-director Ron Maxwell chronicles the early events of the American Civil War. It's a prequel to his earlier GETTYSBURG, with some of the same cast, and is part of a planned trilogy. Stephen Lang plays Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson, the famous (and deeply religious) Confederate general who, along with fellow General Robert E. Lee (Robert Duvall), must weigh the mighty consequences of his actions, as each battle costs the lives of thousands of men. Over on the Union side there's Jeff Daniels as Colonel Joshua Chamberlain, who, like Jackson and Lee, is fond of making long, poetic speeches to his troops. Beginning with the start of the war and ending with Jackson's death, the film chronicles the three main battles leading up to Gettysburg, using their actual locations and thousands of actual Civil War re-enactors as extras. Maxwell pays careful attention to authentic period detail as he chronicles the minutiae of the generals' domestic lives in the intervals between the harrowing battle scenes. While a little on the long side, the end result should serve as an invaluable document for history buffs. Mogul Ted Turner was an executive producer and appears in a small role.

            <description>With THE GOOD SHEPHERD, Robert De Niro (A BRONX TALE) makes an ambitious return to the director's chair. A labor of love for Oscar-winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP), the film tells an epic, fictionalized account of how the Central Intelligence Agency was born. Matt Damon plays Edward Wilson, a reserved young man who graduated from Yale in the late 1930s. His membership in the exclusive, hidden Skull and Bones society led him away from poetry and into a relationship with the federal government, who recruited him to help them on several covert operations. Roth's script alternates between Wilson's gradual emergence as a genuine government operative in the early 1940s and the infamous Bay of Pigs conflict in the early 1960s. Along the way, he has a sweet romance with a pretty deaf girl (a sparkling Tammy Blanchard) and ends up marrying the woman he impregnates (Angelina Jolie) out of a strong sense of duty. Throughout the film, the emergence of a mysterious tape haunts Wilson, who is determined to uncover the truth behind a leak in his secret organization.Production designer Jeannine Claudia Oppewall (L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN) and costume designer Ann Roth (THE ENGLISH PATIENT, THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY) faithfully recreate these earlier periods in American history, while the imagery of Oscar-winning cinematographer Robert Richardson (J.F.K., THE AVIATOR) casts a warm, stately glow upon De Niro's assembled cast of luminaries (including Alec Baldwin, Michael Gambon, William Hurt, Billy Crudup, and Joe Pesci). The result is a production that recalls Francis Ford Coppola's THE CONVERSATION and Steven Spielberg's MUNICH. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.

            <description>GOTHIKA stars Halle Berry as Dr. Miranda Grey, a psychiatrist who becomes a patient in her own mental hospital after she is accused of murdering her husband (Charles S. Dutton). Grey's only initial memory of the incident involves a chilling encounter with a distraught girl (Kathleen Mackey) on a rain-soaked road. The incarcerated and medicated Grey is now haunted by the same apparition, and she must convince her former colleague Pete Graham (Robert Downey Jr.) that she is not insane or guilty of murder. Meanwhile, the seemingly mad ramblings of Chloe (Penelope Cruz), one of Grey's former patients, now make more sense, and Grey must throw aside clinical logic to solve the supernatural murder mystery.Kassovitz, who is already a capable actor (AMELIE) and director (CRIMSON RIVERS), makes the leap to Hollywood filmmaking with GOTHIKA. Drawing from heavily from the Japanese horror renaissance that began with RINGU in the late 1990s, Kassovitz conjures up a forebodingly stark and shadowy tale. Berry continues her remarkable string of success (after her Oscar-winning role in MONSTER'S BALL, along with DIE ANOTHER DAY and X-MEN 2), portraying Grey as a traumatized and vulnerable yet determined woman who must unravel the brutal and bizarre knot of her own lost memory. As Grey's coworker, Downey Jr. adds an intriguing element to the film, and Cruz, as a frustrated inmate, gives an unusual quirky performance. A scare-laden thriller that delights in the strange and the frightening, GOTHIKA proves to be one of the finest of 2003's many horror films. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.

            <description>GOTHIKA stars Halle Berry as Dr. Miranda Grey, a psychiatrist who becomes a patient in her own mental hospital after she is accused of murdering her husband (Charles S. Dutton). Grey's only initial memory of the incident involves a chilling encounter with a distraught girl (Kathleen Mackey) on a rain-soaked road. The incarcerated and medicated Grey is now haunted by the same apparition, and she must convince her former colleague Pete Graham (Robert Downey Jr.) that she is not insane or guilty of murder. Meanwhile, the seemingly mad ramblings of Chloe (Penelope Cruz), one of Grey's former patients, now make more sense, and Grey must throw aside clinical logic to solve the supernatural murder mystery.Kassovitz, who is already a capable actor (AMELIE) and director (CRIMSON RIVERS), makes the leap to Hollywood filmmaking with GOTHIKA. Drawing from heavily from the Japanese horror renaissance that began with RINGU in the late 1990s, Kassovitz conjures up a forebodingly stark and shadowy tale. Berry continues her remarkable string of success (after her Oscar-winning role in MONSTER'S BALL, along with DIE ANOTHER DAY and X-MEN 2), portraying Grey as a traumatized and vulnerable yet determined woman who must unravel the brutal and bizarre knot of her own lost memory. As Grey's coworker, Downey Jr. adds an intriguing element to the film, and Cruz, as a frustrated inmate, gives an unusual quirky performance. A scare-laden thriller that delights in the strange and the frightening, GOTHIKA proves to be one of the finest of 2003's many horror films. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.

            <description>GRAND PRIX is John Frankenheimer's film about the nine-leg world championship of Formula 1 auto racing, and stars James Garner as driver Pete Aron. During the opening race in Monaco, a collision sends Pete's car flying into the Monte Carlo harbor, and British driver Scott Stoddard (Brian Bedford) into a wall. While Pete survives unhurt, Scott may lose the use of his legs, and many hold Pete responsible. Jean-Pierre Sarti (Yves Montand), whose marital boredom has led to an affair with fashion editor Louse Frederickson (Eva-Marie Saint), wins the next race at Clermont-Ferrand. Afterwards Pete accepts the sponsorship of Japanese business magnate Izo Yamura (Toshiro Mifune), and begins to romance Stoddard's jaded young wife Pat (Jessica Walter). Pete wins the Belgian leg of the contest, but Sarti goes into a depression after skidding on a wet track and killing two children in a crash. After Pete also takes the German Grand Prix, Stoddard amazingly returns for the Dutch event, and, driving on sheer grit, pulls out a victory.  He proves it's no fluke by also winning  in Watkins Glen, N.Y. and in Mexico, making the championship competitive once again. Essentially a soap opera interspersed with racing footage,  the film's existence was ascribed by Frankenheimer to his fascination with the sport and a desire to spend time in Europe. That said, the racing sequences are still among the most realistic ever put on film, jammed with wide-angle helicopter shots, you-are-there car-mounted cameras, and then-fashionable split-screen sequences. GRAND PRIX is a definitely a film or racing fans. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.  All rights reserved.</description>

            <description>After New Orleans hospice worker Caroline (Kate Hudson) answers a help wanted ad, she finds herself working as the live-in caretaker of Ben Devereaux (John Hurt), a stroke victim who has lost his ability to speak. Ben's wife, Violet (Gena Rowlands), presents Caroline with a skeleton key to open any door in the house--with the exception of one, which she claims she has never been able to open. But curiosity gets the best of her, and Caroline opens the door to find a wealth of materials representing the old house's history of hoodoo, an ancient form of folk magic. She soon discovers that the house harbors a dark secret--one that Violet knows more about than she first admits.Breaking her string of lighthearted romantic comedies, Kate Hudson gives a performance that proves she's more than capable of playing a feisty damsel in distress. Ehren Kruger's (THE RING) script gives her some physically demanding scenes, while providing the audience with a steady string of effective jolts culminating in a SIXTH SENSE-style twist that few are likely to see coming. Louisiana's swampy, heavy atmosphere is literally a character in the film, while Gena Rowlands, at age 75, astounds once again with one of her most surprising roles. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.

            <description>Burt Reynolds stars as the Bandit in this seminal portrayal of rough-ridin', beer-swillin', sheriff-dodgin', trouble-chasin' truckers. The Bandit's has taken on his craziest haul yet: a trailer full of Coors beer. If he can deliver the goods from Texarcana to Atlanta within forty-eight hours, he'll be $80,000 richer. Hilarious mayhem ensues, however, when the Bandit falls for a runaway bride (Sally Field). As they push toward Atlanta, the two have to evade Fields' vengeful father-in-law, Texas Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason as the maniac "Smokey" of the title). The stakes get higher and the car chases more frenzied in this hysterical romp through the American highways. Charismatic performances by Reynolds and Gleason made this a huge box office draw. ITA winner. Academy Award Nominations: Best Film Editing. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.

            <description>Burt Reynolds stars as the Bandit in this seminal portrayal of rough-ridin', beer-swillin', sheriff-dodgin', trouble-chasin' truckers. The Bandit's has taken on his craziest haul yet: a trailer full of Coors beer. If he can deliver the goods from Texarcana to Atlanta within forty-eight hours, he'll be $80,000 richer. Hilarious mayhem ensues, however, when the Bandit falls for a runaway bride (Sally Field). As they push toward Atlanta, the two have to evade Fields' vengeful father-in-law, Texas Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason as the maniac "Smokey" of the title). The stakes get higher and the car chases more frenzied in this hysterical romp through the American highways. Charismatic performances by Reynolds and Gleason made this a huge box office draw. ITA winner. Academy Award Nominations: Best Film Editing. Copyright (C) Muze Inc. 2005.  For personal use only.

            <description>Fresh from his success with HBO's ENTOURAGE, Jeremy Piven gives his career a further boost by taking the lead role in director Joe Carnahan's (NARC) fast-paced thriller, SMOKING ACES. Piven plays Buddy "Aces" Israel, a former Vegas performer who has holed up in the penthouse suite of a Lake Tahoe casino after what seems like half the planet decides they want him dead. The reason for this bloodlust stems from Israel's dalliances with the mob, who have put a $1 million price tag on his head after discovering he is about to tell all to the feds. The only people who don't want to put a premature end to Israel's life are two FBI agents, played by Ryan Reynolds and Ray Liotta, and their boss, Andy Garcia. As various assassins attempt to put an end to Israel's pitiful existence, a parade of celebrity cameos ensues, including Alicia Keys, Common, Ben Affleck, and Jason Bateman.Carnahan soaks the screen with vivid primary colors, lots of flashy set pieces, and plenty of guns and violence as his movie thunders from one explosive scene to the next. The shooting style, script, and acting are all highly indebted to Quentin Tarantino's early works, and the impressive ensemble cast will ensure plenty of PULP FICTION comparisons. Standout performances come courtesy of Piven and Liotta, with the former reveling in a character surrounded by burly bodyguards, cheap hookers, and a blizzard of cocaine as he sweats and paces around his penthouse hideout, ultimately awaiting either freedom or death as the movie nears its spectacular finale.
